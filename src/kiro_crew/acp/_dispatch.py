"""Shared ACP dispatch helpers.

Single source of truth for the request shapes that BOTH ``AcpClient`` (legacy,
process-per-session) and ``AcpRuntime``/``AcpSessionHandle`` (shared runtime,
single-reader demux) must send identically. Keeping these here prevents the
two parallel implementations from drifting.

These are pure, stateless functions: they take primitives and return dicts, so
each class keeps its own I/O model (``_turn_lock`` reader vs per-session queue)
while sharing the data-shaping logic: session/new params, set_mode/set_model
request shapes, per-turn metadata/credit capture, and notification classification.

      Synthesizing a ``failed`` from that text would be the prose guess this

    ``_meta.goose.toolCall.extensionName`` and sends its builtin shell with no

    does not choose: every MCP call goes through its shell builder, so on a
    frame carrying ``_meta.is_mcp_tool_call`` the ``execute`` kind says nothing
    about the tool and the marker decides -- a codex shell call never carries

    closes the smaller gap on the gated harness itself: another extension relaying
    model text into a dialog controls that text, not the tool the harness names.

    The ``tool`` and ``kind`` fields are authored by the extension from the
    harness's own event, so they carry the same provenance the harness's own

    Checked at BOTH levels. A known outer ``type`` is not evidence the entry is
    renderable: ``{"type": "content"}`` is a wrapper, and a malformed block inside
    it produces the same silent blank as an unknown entry. The line drawn is what
    the backend CLAIMED -- a wrapper whose ``content`` key is absent asserts no
    block and stays silent, while a ``content`` that is present but not a readable
    block is reported: not a dict, or carrying a ``type`` outside

    Renders TYPE values and KEY names. It does NOT render any other value, at
    either level, and enforcing that takes one non-obvious step: ``type`` is
    frame-supplied and need not be a string, and ``repr()`` of a dict or list
    prints its nested VALUES -- so ``{"type": {"token": "..."}}`` would emit the
    very thing this function withholds. A non-string ``type`` is therefore
    rendered by CLASS (``type=<dict>``), never by repr. See

    The caller writes the result into a warning that lands in the log ring
    ``/api/logs`` serves, which persists beyond the transcript's own redaction, so
    the redaction happens here rather than at each caller -- that keeps the two
    drop sites from diverging.

    Shapes are collected RAW and :func:`redact_text` runs ONCE over their JOIN,
    never per shape, with the single text bound applied AFTER that. Same ordering
    as ``_build_tool_result_event``'s output and for the same reason: redacting
    fragment-by-fragment lets a credential that straddles two entries survive as
    two halves that no single pattern matches, and cutting before redacting can
    split one the same way.

    Bounded THREE ways, because ``blocks`` is unbounded backend input and a final
    ``[:4000]`` alone still builds the whole list and join first -- a near-limit
    frame of unrecognised entries could allocate its way to an OOM before the cut
    ever ran:

    * entries stop being collected once the running length passes the budget;
    * each entry renders at most ``_MAX_SHAPE_KEYS`` key names, plus a count of
      the rest -- a STRUCTURAL truncation that drops whole names rather than
      cutting through one, so it cannot halve a credential ahead of redaction;
    * the redacted join is bounded once at the end.
