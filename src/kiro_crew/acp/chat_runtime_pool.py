"""Share one ``AcpRuntime`` process across several top-level chat sessions.

Subagents already multiplex sessions onto their parent's process. This module
extends the same demux to top-level dashboard chat slots, which otherwise spawn
one ``kiro-cli`` process each.

Three rules govern it, and each exists because breaking it is silently wrong
rather than loudly wrong:

``eligible_for_chat_sharing``
    Only a dashboard chat slot running in persistent memory mode may share. A
    cron, hook, task-runner or crew-member session keeps its own process, and so
    does an incognito or temporary session -- see the function's own reasoning.

:class:`ChatRuntimeKey`
    Two sessions may land on one process only when every PROCESS-LEVEL spawn
    input matches. A per-session input (the ACP ``cwd``, the session key, the
    crew identity) is deliberately absent from the key, because ``create_session``
    carries it per session. An input whose scope is ambiguous is IN the key: a
    key that is too narrow costs memory, while one that is too wide runs a
    session under another session's process configuration.

:class:`ChatRuntimePool`
    A runtime lives while at least one session holds it. The last release kills
    it; every earlier release only drops a reference. The cap bounds how many
    sessions one process serves, which is the blast radius of that process
    dying. Placement is the first compatible runtime with room for the session,
    otherwise a fresh process.

    ``"dashboard"`` only for a chat slot -- a cron, hook, task-runner, subagent
    or channel-bound key classifies as something else, so each keeps its own
    process without this function naming any of them.

    A chat slot is necessary but NOT sufficient. ``backend`` must also be a host

    ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING`` -- the same capability the subagent sharing
    path already requires. A host outside it is served by ``AcpRuntime`` yet maps

    the transcript protects nothing: the pooled teardown destroys this session's
    handle to leave a process it may not kill, so on such a host every ordinary
    chat close would discard its own resume record. Membership is asked rather
    than a specific host being excluded, so a host added later is out until
    someone puts it in deliberately.

    This cannot be settled by the compatibility key: two sessions on the SAME
    unsupported backend have equal keys, so they would pool with each other,
