"""Localized parsing for the second ACP backend's KAS-specific wire surfaces.

Two surfaces live here, and they share one property: the shapes are the second
backend's, not ordinary ACP, so this module is the ONE place Kiro Crew reads or
builds them and an adjustment is a single-file edit.

1. ``session/update`` display/telemetry frames, whose discriminant blob arrives
   in a different shape than ``kiro-cli``'s. The handlers that act on a parsed
   frame live in :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.session_handle`.
2. The **hooks** surface: the backend can delegate hook extraction AND
   execution to its ACP client, asking ``_kiro/hooks/list`` for the hooks
   matching a trigger, ``_kiro/hooks/sessionStart`` for results computed before
   the turn, and ``_kiro/hooks/executeHook`` to run one listed hook's command.
   Kiro Crew answers all three from its own hook store, so the matcher stays on
   the side where the UI that authored the hook lives, and the command is spawned
   by Kiro Crew -- in its process, behind its own deny floor and governance gate
   -- rather than by the backend. The handshake does not announce the surface
   (see ``KAS_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES``), so today the backend asks none of them.

The literals below are only what Kiro Crew must match to route a frame or answer
a request; the backend's own internals are not documented here.

The ids this module mints are Kiro Crew's own, and the execute path runs only one
that a list answer produced for the Kiro Crew session that asks:
:class:`ListedHookStore` is that record, keyed by the OWNING Kiro Crew session
key and never by the host-supplied ``sessionId`` (see
``docs/system-specs/modules/agent-host-contract.md``).
