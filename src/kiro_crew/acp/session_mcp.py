"""Kiro agent spec -> the ACP ``session/new`` ``mcpServers`` array.

For a harness in :data:`~kiro_crew.acp_backends.ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY`,
the ``session/new`` / ``session/load`` ``mcpServers`` parameter is where Kiro
Crew's MCP servers come from and the only place: neither claude-agent-acp nor
codex-acp reads ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``. kiro-cli reads native servers
through ``--agent``; managed control planes can also receive per-session
overrides solely to carry ordinary identity. Without
the translation here such a session runs with ZERO Kiro Crew tools -- the harness
itself works (prompts, streaming, permissions) but ``send_message``,
``spawn_run``, ``cron_add`` and every user-installed server are simply absent.

Nothing here is Anthropic-specific by design: the module is keyed on the
capability, not on the harness, so the next adapter that reads no agent spec of
Crew's joins the set rather than growing a second translator. What is genuinely
per-adapter stays with that adapter's mirror -- codex narrows this output in
:mod:`kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.codex` (it drops any transport this session's
adapter did not advertise, and its child processes inherit no environment), and
the shape notes below are claude-agent-acp's own zod schema.

The agent spec stays the single source of truth; there is no second,
claude-shaped registry to keep in sync. It is read per spawn, so installing or
toggling an MCP server takes effect on the NEXT session with no gateway restart.
Nothing here raises: a missing or malformed spec degrades to Crew's own control
plane, never to a failed spawn.

Shape notes -- these are claude-agent-acp's zod schema rather than anything in
the ACP spec at large:

* ``env`` (stdio) and ``headers`` (http/sse) are REQUIRED arrays of
  ``{"name", "value"}`` objects. Omitting either fails ``session/new`` outright
  with ``-32602 Invalid params (expected array, received undefined)``, so they
  are always emitted -- empty when there is nothing to carry.
* A url-bearing entry is routed by ``type``. Without one the adapter takes the
  stdio branch and rejects the entry for having no ``command``, so the transport
  is always spelled out.
* kiro-cli-only keys (``timeout``, ``disabledTools``, ``autoApprove``) cannot
  ride along in an element. ``disabledTools`` is a RESTRICTION, so dropping it
  outright would widen the tool surface; it comes back as a
  ``permissions.deny`` rule instead (see :func:`session_mcp_deny_rules`).
  ``autoApprove`` is dropped deliberately, not for want of a mapping:
  Claude's nearest equivalent is a ``permissions.allow`` entry, and a
  pre-approved tool is one Claude never asks about -- so the call never reaches
  the host ``canUseTool`` gate that carries the deny floor, the sensitive-path
  check and the governance ceiling. Every MCP call on this backend is gated.

**The governing rule, stated once because each corner of it is easy to argue
separately: this module matches kiro-cli, and deviating in EITHER direction
is the defect.** Granting what kiro-cli would drop widens the session's tool
surface behind the user's back; withholding what kiro-cli would keep removes
capability from a session with no error to explain it. Two consequences that are
otherwise easy to argue backwards:

* **Which specs are resolved.** kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` against the project
  checkout's ``.kiro/agents/*.json`` as well as ``~/.kiro/agents/``, so this
  module must too, project-nearest first. Resolving only the user level looked
  conservative and was the opposite: a project-only agent found no spec, so its
  ``tools`` allowlist never ran and the control plane mounted unrestricted --
  a user-declared restriction dropped silently. See :func:`_agent_spec_for`.
* **What the registry ceiling governs.** Registry mode withholds every
  SPEC-DECLARED server, because nothing here can resolve a marker against the
  admin's catalog. It does NOT withhold Crew's own control plane, which is
  re-derived from the managed source rather than read from the spec. That is
  kiro-cli parity, not an exemption: ``agent._install_agent_spec`` stamps the
  managed servers with ``"type": "registry"`` precisely so the client keeps them
  under registry mode, and ``agent._mcp_registry_mode`` records their
  disappearance as the defect ("the features they carry (``spawn_run``,
  ``cron_add``, ``learn_add``, ...) disappear with no local error"). Withholding
  them HERE would make this backend stricter than kiro-cli and reproduce that
  failure on the installs least able to diagnose it. The control plane is still
  subject to the ``tools`` allowlist, which is the restriction that does apply.

# PUBLIC on this module because the codex projection carries this session's
# identity onto these two entries and onto NOTHING else, and the safety of that
# carriage rests on this being the set the loop below REPLACES from the managed
# source: the element's command, args and env are Crew's own by construction, not
# the spec's. The definition sits in the leaf so a consumer the agent-SDK import
# boundary keeps off ``kiro_crew.acp`` -- the broker-stub ceiling in
# ``mcp_gateway.session_servers`` -- reads the same tuple rather than a second
# copy of it.

# Every managed Crew server that must be handed the session's IDENTITY when it
# is mounted -- a wider set than the control plane above, and a different
# question. The control plane is what a session gets whether or not its spec
# names it; this is what a session's tool calls on any Crew server need to
# succeed. Each of these servers runs through ``mcp_shared.run_mcp_stdio_loop``,
# whose ``tools/call`` reads the session's tool policy from the gateway, and the
# gateway reads a declared session key only behind an attestation. A server that
# is granted (``@kirocrew-dashboard`` in ``tools``) but carries no token comes up
# present-but-unusable: it resolves the session key through the pid sidecar and
# then refuses every call as ``identity_unattested``. On the kiro backend the
# runtime is session-unbound, so identity travels per MCP element
# (:func:`kiro_control_plane_servers`), and that carriage has to cover the
# opt-in servers too, not only the two always-on ones.
#
# Derived from the managed set rather than spelled out so a server added to it
# later is covered by construction; gatewayd mirrors this for its per-frame
# token hand-off (``CONTROL_PLANE_BACKENDS``) and a ratchet test pins the two.

    entry it rewrites, so a stub for a server the spec's ``tools`` never
    references is an unreferenced server mounted anyway, which is the exact
    thing the filter on the translated half exists to prevent.

    ``applies`` is False when there is no spec at all: then there is no allowlist
    to apply and everything stands, the same reading :func:`session_mcp_servers`
    takes for the control plane. A spec whose ``tools`` is missing or not a list
    is an EMPTY allowlist, not "no filter" (see the filter's own comment).

    Why an allowlist at all: kiro-cli loads a server only when ``tools`` references
    it (``@server`` or ``@server/tool``), so an ``mcpServers`` entry with no
    reference is declared but never mounted. An ACP array has no such indirection

    alive the moment the session ran on a mirrored backend.

    The refs are read through :func:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.mcp_refs.parse_tools_refs`

    disagree about what an entry names -- a guard that read ``@srv`` where this

    grants everything: ``@*`` is a server LITERALLY named ``*`` there, matching

    pairs as claude ``permissions.deny`` rules. Kept as PAIRS here because the
    ``mcp__server__tool`` spelling is lossy -- it splits on the last ``__``, so a
    tool name containing ``__`` reads back as part of the server -- and a consumer
    that compares against an identity the adapter reports as two separate fields
    (codex's ``rawInput.server`` / ``rawInput.tool``) must not go through it.

    No server is exempt, the control plane included. This set answers "what did
    the user switch off", and that is true of ``kirocrew-core`` exactly as it is
    of a third-party server: the dashboard writes the key on an ordinary tool-off
    action for any of them. What differs per server is how -- or whether -- a
    given backend can HONOUR it, and that is the caller's question, not this one's
    (see :func:`session_mcp_restricted_servers` for the one place the control
    plane is treated differently, and why).

    Two sources, unioned. The agent spec carries the key when a spec author wrote
    it or the rebuild copied a global entry in. The global ``settings/mcp.json``
    carries it when the dashboard's tool-off action wrote it -- and for Crew's own
    managed servers that is the ONLY place it can be, because the spec rebuild
    never copies a global entry onto a managed server (see
    :func:`_global_settings`). kiro-cli reads both for enforcement; so does this.
    A union is the only safe combination: a restriction can only ever restrict.

    ``spec`` and ``settings`` let a caller hand in what it has ALREADY parsed; an
    explicit ``None`` spec means "there is no spec" and is honoured as such, never
    re-read (see :class:`_Unread`). Never raises: an unreadable source switches
    nothing off from that source.

    A different question from :func:`session_mcp_restricted_servers`, and the

    server the user still wants, while ``disabled`` withdraws the server itself. The
    array honours that through the ``tools`` allowlist -- ``agent.build_agent_config``
    strips a disabled server's ``@alias``, so nothing mounts it -- but an allowlist
    only governs elements the SPEC describes. A caller that appends an element of its
    OWN (``AcpClient._append_member_dispatch_server``, which mounts a server the
    template deliberately does not name) is outside that rule and has to ask this.

    Unlike the restriction sets there is no backend condition on the answer: a
    whole-server disable has no per-call form, so no harness can refuse a call to a
    server it was handed. The only faithful action anywhere is not mounting it.

    """Servers whose per-TOOL narrowing no transport can carry as an element.

    The sibling of :func:`session_mcp_deny_rules`, for a backend that has no file
    to put deny rules in. Same input, same reason to exist: ``disabledTools`` is a
    RESTRICTION, and a backend that forwards the server while dropping it widens
    the session's tool surface behind the user's back -- the dashboard writes that
    key on an ordinary tool-off action, and this repo already treats losing it as a
    defect ("dropping ``disabledTools`` on a save would silently widen the agent's
    tool surface").

    Claude re-applies the restriction as ``permissions.deny`` rules and so may keep
    the server. A backend with no deny channel has only one faithful option, which
    is to not mount the server at all -- so this returns the NAMES and lets that
    backend omit them. Withholding a server is an availability cost; forwarding an
    un-narrowed one is a capability the user switched off.

    **Crew's own control plane is exempt from WITHHOLDING, not from the
    restriction.** ``kirocrew-core`` / ``kirocrew-cron`` are re-derived from
    ``managed_mcp_spec_entry``, which emits only command/args/env, so a
    ``disabledTools`` on their spec entry never reaches the element -- and
    withholding the whole server on the strength of it would leave the session
    unable to report back to its channel at all, which is the exact defect this
    module exists to fix. The restriction itself is still honoured, on the one
    channel this transport does have: every call to one of these servers reaches
    Crew as a ``session/request_permission`` (their tools carry no annotations, so
    codex prompts for each), and the client answers a call to a switched-off tool
    with the adapter's reject option before anything runs. The pairs it checks
    come from :func:`session_mcp_disabled_tools`, on the same parse as this set.
    That channel is complete for the control plane and NOT for a third-party
    server -- a tool annotated ``readOnlyHint`` is auto-approved inside codex and
    never prompts -- which is why the two are treated differently here rather
    than both being mounted.

    ``disabled`` is deliberately NOT part of this. A disabled server is already
    absent from the array by a different mechanism: ``agent.build_agent_config``
    strips its ``@alias`` from ``tools``, and the allowlist filter in
    :func:`session_mcp_servers` mounts nothing ``tools`` does not name. Re-checking
    it here would be a second spelling of a rule that already holds.

    Derived from the ``(server, tool)`` PAIRS :func:`session_mcp_disabled_tools`
    resolved, never from the spec on its own, so the two decisions a restriction
    drives -- withhold the server, or refuse the call -- read the same sources. The
    dashboard's tool-off action writes to the global settings file and not to the
    spec, so a withhold set read from the spec alone would miss a third-party server
    narrowed the ordinary way; that server would mount, and the per-call refusal
    cannot reach it (a tool annotated ``readOnlyHint`` is approved inside codex
    without asking), so the switched-off tool would run. Its one caller is
    :func:`session_mcp_projection`, which hands in the pairs it already resolved
    from one read of each source. A server named only in the global file and not in
    the spec lands here too and is harmless: nothing mounts it. Free of I/O.

    """Carry ordinary session identity without widening Kiro's native tool surface.

    Only an existing managed stdio declaration can be overridden. Native-only
    restrictions stay in the native declaration instead of being discarded by
    ACP shaping. Registry entries remain the enterprise catalog's responsibility.
    The element's ``env`` is owned by :func:`_managed_element_env`, which holds it to
    the rule the disk-writing consumer applies to this same population.

    Covers every server in :data:`IDENTITY_BOUND_SERVERS` the spec grants, not
    only the control plane: an opt-in server such as ``kirocrew-dashboard`` is
    mounted by kiro-cli straight from the spec with no session-valued environment,
    so this element is the ONLY way its calls can carry the attestation the
    gateway's tool-policy read demands. The grant itself is still the spec's --
    ``allow.grants`` -- and the expected invocation is resolved with
    :func:`~kiro_crew.agent.managed_mcp_spec_entry` under ``include_opt_in=True``,
    the same form ``mcp_gateway.gatewayd`` reads: it answers for a granted opt-in
    server where the writers' emission question would refuse to mint one, and
    still yields ``None`` behind a closed ``spec_gate``.
