"""Backup — memory/workspace snapshots and session archives on ``backup/``.

Two backup kinds, one push path:

* **Snapshot** (the mockup's "Memory & workspace" row): the existing
  ``kiro_crew.snapshot`` engine builds its portable ``.tar.gz`` (memory,
  crons, config, skills, workspace, notifications, security — its component
  set, unchanged), and the archive is pushed to
  ``backup/snapshots/<install>/<name>.tar.gz``.
* **Sessions archive** (the "Sessions archive" row): one tarball of BOTH
  session halves — ``<data home>/sessions/`` (transcripts + rotated
  archives) and ``<kiro home>/sessions/cli/`` (the CLI replay logs) -- plus a
  table-scoped export of the kiro-cli TERMINAL conversation store (see
  "Terminal conversations" below), pushed to
  ``backup/sessions/<install>/<stamp>.tar.gz``. Whole-set, not per-session:
  the "both halves move together" invariant is honoured by construction, and a
  run whose trees have not moved since the archive already in the drive uploads
  nothing at all -- see "Unchanged runs upload nothing" below. Splitting the set
  into per-session objects and sending only the changed ones is a different
  feature and deliberately not this one: the RFC lists incremental and
  deduplicating transfer among its non-goals.

**Terminal conversations (``conversations/`` root).** The two transcript halves
above are the GATEWAY's session state; the terminal (kiro-cli itself) keeps its
own conversations in ``conversations_v2`` inside
``~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3``, a store disjoint from both halves.
That file is ALSO the identity auth store -- ``hooks.py`` classifies it as a
token path and it holds live bearer tokens -- so the archive
must never carry the file. It carries a table-scoped export instead: a fresh
database holding ONLY the tables in ``_CONVERSATION_TABLES`` (an allowlist, so no
identity or token TABLE can leak even if kiro-cli adds one -- the bound is per
table and not per column, see ``_copy_table``), read from the live
store under a single read-only snapshot as ``_export_cli_conversations``
documents, under
the ``conversations/`` archive root beside ``crew`` and ``cli``. The store is
looked up among FIXED, home-anchored locations only: ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` /
``LOCALAPPDATA`` are not consulted, because the fence that keeps agent file tools
out of this store is home-anchored and does not follow a redirected root, and this
archive is uploaded off-host unattended. A host that relocates its store therefore
gets no ``conversations/`` root, and the run record says so through
``conversations_skipped`` rather than leaving an operator to infer it from an
absent member. The DECLARED
BOUNDARY of "conversation state" for this app is exactly ``conversations_v2``;
if a future table is genuinely conversation state and not auth, it is added to
``_CONVERSATION_TABLES`` and this sentence is updated in the same change --
there is no other place the boundary is expressed. The export rides the SAME
standing permission as the ``cli`` half, :func:`sessions_layer_b_enabled`, and
invents no new grant: both carry what a model actually held, where
the crew transcript carries what was displayed with display-time redaction
applied. Neither is shipped raw: every text column of an exported conversation row
goes through ``_redacted_row`` first, so what leaves the host is
EGRESS-REDACTED, so an install whose operator withholds Layer B gets an archive with no
``conversations/`` root either. Reading the store is RECORDED through the
sanctioned credential-read audit
(``hooks.emit_internal_read_audit`` under ``aws_control.conversation_export``,
registered in ``hooks._AUDIT_ONLY_READ_IDS``), which runs after the read rather
than gating it -- it is an access log, not an authorization. What FAILS CLOSED is
the SHIPPING: an export whose
access cannot be recorded is dropped from the archive rather than shipped
unaudited, because the file holds live bearer tokens whatever this reader
touches.

**One drive can be reached by several installs.** Discovery is by tag, so a
second install finds the first one's bucket and writes to it by design — the
``<install>`` segment is what keeps the two apart afterwards, and it is a
random per-install id held in this app's own state, never the telemetry
install id. An archive uploaded before that segment existed carries no id and
is reported as being of unknown origin rather than claimed by whoever is
reading. See the "install identity" section below for why the id decides what
is permitted while the human-readable label decides only what is displayed.

**Restore is a download, deliberately.** A restore lands the archive in
``<app data dir>/restore/`` and hands back the path; nothing hot-swaps a
live ``memory.db`` or sessions dir under a running gateway. The snapshot
engine's own merge/replace tooling (or a stopped gateway) takes it from
there, and the UI copy says exactly that.

State (`<app data dir>/backup.json`): this install's identity, plus the last
run per kind, the nightly toggle per account, and the per-account retention
count. The nightly loop lives in the app's ``on_startup`` hook.

**Unchanged runs upload nothing.** Every run builds its archive, then asks whether
that archive carries anything the drive does not already hold; if not, it records a
run saying so and sends no bytes. The comparison CANNOT be over archive bytes -- a
``tar.gz`` embeds per-entry mtimes and a gzip stamp, so two runs over an identical
tree produce different bytes and an archive-level check would report "changed" every
night. It is taken over the entry set instead (path, kind, permission mode, size and
content hash per member: ``_tree_fingerprint``), read from the packed payload so it
cannot drift from what would actually be sent. A skip is refused unless the previous
archive is PROVEN still in the drive at its recorded key and its recorded length,
because a record proves only that this install once wrote that key -- retention
deletes by design and a co-writer can overwrite a name. Every uncertain branch
uploads. See ``_unchanged_baseline``, which lists them.

**Retention runs after a successful push, never before it.** Both key shapes
above carry a timestamp, so nothing is ever overwritten and an unbounded drive
was the default: a nightly backup added one archive a night forever. Each push
therefore ends by retiring this install's oldest archives OF THAT KIND, but only
once an operator has set a count: retention is opt-in, and with no usable count
every archive is kept. The bucket is
versioned, so the sweep deletes object VERSIONS rather than objects -- a plain
delete would leave a marker and go on billing for the bytes behind it. It is
best-effort: a cleanup that fails logs one line and leaves the successful backup
alone. See ``_prune_remote_archives``.

CALLER CONTRACT: handlers hold the consent gate; sync, subprocess/tar-bound
— call via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (pushes of a large sessions set can run
minutes; handlers use generous timeouts).

#: inheriting whichever guess happened to be written first -- and the guess that
#: was written first here was the interactive one, which attributed unattended
#: nightly work to a human who was not present.

KIND_SNAPSHOT = "snapshot"
KIND_SESSIONS = "sessions"

#: Wall clock for one backup push to S3, passed by both runners into
#: :func:`storage.put_file` rather than relying on its 600s default. The
#: nightly snapshot push runs unattended, and an owner-triggered sessions
#: archive may legitimately need the full hour -- the size ceiling is
#: ``storage._MAX_PINNED_TRANSFER_BYTES`` (5 GiB), which at 3600s still
#: requires a ~12 Mbit/s uplink, so a slower push fails at the bound rather
#: than holding the owner-billed transfer open indefinitely. Tests assert the
#: constant reaches the uploader on both paths, so it cannot go unread.
_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS = 3600

#: Wall clock allowed for the authorization that runs inside the state lock: the
#: STS identity check is bounded by ``deploy.engine._checked``'s own 30s default,
#: and this leaves the same again for the local consent and app-enabled reads
#: that follow it.
_AUTHORIZE_TIMEOUT_SECS = 60

#: How long a contender waits for the state file's sidecar lock. The Layer B
#: upload gate holds it across that authorization and the archive PUT, so the
#: wait must outlast their sum. ``platform_compat``'s default ceiling is
#: ``_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS`` (300s), sized for a sub-second read plus an atomic
#: rename, and ``file_lock`` requires any caller that can hold the lock longer to
#: override it -- otherwise the ceiling refuses a contender while this holder is
#: still working rather than because it is stuck. That refusal is not cosmetic:
#: it arrives as the ``OSError`` :func:`_record_run` absorbs, which keeps the run
#: in memory only, so a short-lived process that exits first loses it and leaves
#: the nightly loop due and re-uploading. Derived from the bounds it must cover
#: so the two cannot drift apart.
_STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS = float(_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS + _AUTHORIZE_TIMEOUT_SECS)


#: Backup state, holding the ``nightly`` bit that AUTHORIZES the unattended
#: upload loop. ``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` carries the matching
#: ``apps/aws-control/data`` entry, which puts this file -- and the atomic-write
#: temporary it is renamed from, and every sibling state file -- behind the
#: shared agent file-tool floor. The owner toggles nightly through the
#: owner-gated endpoint, and an agent cannot flip it by writing any path in
#: there. A test pins the two together, because moving this file out of that
#: directory would silently un-protect it.
STATE_DIR_LEAF = f"apps/{APP_NAME}/data"

#: Per-account key in the state document holding the operator's Layer B decision
#: for the sessions archive. Named here rather than spelled inline because the
#: reader, the writer and the test that pins the default all have to agree on it,
#: and a typo in any one of them would read as "not permitted" -- a silent OFF is
#: the failure this constant exists to make impossible.
SESSIONS_LAYER_B_KEY = "sessionsIncludeLayerB"

#: Per-account key recording WHICH SCOPE the operator's Layer B grant was made
#: under. The grant itself is one boolean and stays one boolean -- this is not a
#: second toggle and gives the operator nothing new to set. It exists because the
#: grant's meaning widened: a grant recorded before the terminal conversation
#: export was disclosed authorized this product's own ``cli`` session files, and
#: reading it as also authorizing ``conversations_v2`` would ship host-wide
#: terminal context on a consent that never mentioned it, off-host and
#: unrecallable. Written by :func:`set_sessions_layer_b` only when the caller NAMES
#: this scope in the request: a bare enable carries no evidence of what the operator
#: was shown, so an idempotent retry, an automation, and a client rendering older copy
#: are indistinguishable from a deliberate re-consent, and none of them may widen what
#: leaves the machine.
SESSIONS_LAYER_B_SCOPE_KEY = "sessionsLayerBScope"

#: The one scope value that covers the conversation export. Matched EXACTLY: an
#: absent marker, a different string, or a non-string all read as cli-only. That is
#: the fail-closed direction, and it is the direction a stored value this code does
#: not understand must take -- widening on an unrecognised marker is how a consent
#: boundary stops holding.
SESSIONS_LAYER_B_SCOPE_WITH_CONVERSATIONS = "cli+conversations"

#: Per-account fact: at least one sessions archive this install uploaded and has NOT
#: retired carries a ``conversations/`` root. It is the ONE thing the retention sweep
#: needs in order to tell "this run carries no conversations and none were ever
#: retained" -- prune, nothing is at risk -- from "this run carries none while an older
#: retained archive does" -- do not prune, that archive is the only copy.
#:
#: Deliberately ONE BOOLEAN read through a predicate, not a list of archives or of
#: qualifying reasons. A second list that has to stay in sync with the archives is a
#: place to forget one, and the cost of forgetting here is a permanent delete.
#:
#: It only ever goes True, and that is correct rather than lazy: while it is True the
#: sweep is declined, so the archive it refers to is never retired, so the fact stays
#: true. A run that DOES carry conversations prunes normally -- the newest archive holds
#: them, so retiring older ones loses nothing -- which is what lets retention resume.
SESSIONS_CONVERSATIONS_RETAINED_KEY = "sessionsConversationsRetained"

#: The same fact carried ON the run record. It has to travel there as well, because the
#: ACCOUNT-level key does not survive a failed state write: ``_remember_unpersisted``
#: holds only the run record, and ``_merge_pending`` restores records, uploads and
#: versions -- no account-level key. Held only on the account, the fact would vanish on an
#: ``ENOSPC`` or read-only-filesystem write while the archive it protects stayed in the
#: drive, and the only thing that could set it again is another conversation-bearing run,

# waits for the sidecar file lock. ``_run_lock`` also serializes :func:`last_runs`,
# which the dashboard's backup-status read goes through, and the file lock is held
# across a PUT allowed ``_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS`` -- so a writer parked on the file lock
# while holding ``_run_lock`` puts every account's status read behind one account's
# upload, across accounts. Omitting ``_run_lock`` from the upload gate alone did not
# fix that: the stall arrived through the contending WRITER, not through the upload.

    the invariant the upload owns is that a consent withdrawal cannot interleave
    between its recheck and the PUT, and that is a cross-process AND cross-thread
    ordering against the SETTER, not against the reader.

    The setters (:func:`set_sessions_layer_b` and :func:`set_nightly_sessions`,
    each -> :func:`_locked_state_update` -> :func:`_state_lock`) take this same
    sidecar file lock EXCLUSIVELY. The file
    lock is per-descriptor, so an exclusive hold here blocks the setter's
    exclusive hold and vice versa, in this process and in a second install
    writing the same state. That is what makes a revocation land wholly before
    this block or wholly after it. The file lock alone carries that ordering, so
    omitting ``_run_lock`` here costs the guarantee nothing.

    Omitting it here is necessary and not sufficient on its own. A contending
    writer reaches this same file lock through :func:`_state_lock`, so a
    :func:`_state_lock` that took ``_run_lock`` BEFORE parking on the file lock
    would leave that writer holding ``_run_lock`` for this upload's whole duration,
    and :func:`last_runs` would queue behind the WRITER rather than behind this
    block. Two of the feature's own paths contend that way: a mid-upload revocation
    (which must contend on the file lock for the ordering above to mean anything)
    and any second account's :func:`_record_run` finishing. What keeps the reader
    free is the module's single acquisition order -- :func:`_state_lock` takes the
    file lock first, and :func:`_record_run` does not wrap it in ``_run_lock``. See
    the lock-order note above :func:`_state_lock`.

    The ceiling is ``_STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS`` for the reason :func:`_state_lock`
    documents: this gate holds the lock across the authorization and a PUT
    allowed an hour, and ``file_lock``'s default would refuse a contender that is
    merely waiting, a refusal :func:`_record_run` absorbs by keeping a completed
    upload's record in memory alone.

    Reentrant only as far as the file lock is -- taken on a fresh descriptor each
    time, so a nested acquisition inside one thread would deadlock. The upload
    gate does not nest, and nothing it reaches (:func:`_authorize_upload`,
    :func:`sessions_layer_b_enabled`, :func:`_refuse_upload`) re-enters it;
    :func:`_record_run` runs after the block has released.

# --- install identity -------------------------------------------------------
#
# One drive can be reached by more than one install: discovery is by tag, so a
# second install finds the first one's bucket and writes into it BY DESIGN. What
# was missing is any way to tell the archives apart afterwards. The key carried a
# timestamp and six hex characters of collision avoidance -- ``_stamp``'s own
# docstring says that suffix is not an identity -- so an operator restoring an
# archive picked it by timestamp alone, and replacing this machine's memory with
# another machine's is the mistake the flat namespace made easy.
#
# The fix is a per-install id in the key prefix, plus a human-readable label
# beside it. The two are NOT interchangeable and the split is the whole design:
# the ID decides what is allowed, the LABEL decides only what a human reads.

#: Top-level key in ``backup.json`` holding this install's identity.
#:
#: Top level rather than under ``accounts``: the install is the same install
#: whichever account it backs up to, and keying it per account would mint a
#: second id for the same machine the first time the owner connects a second
#: account -- which would make one machine look like two in the very listing this
#: id exists to disambiguate.
INSTALL_KEY = "install"

#: An install id: ``uuid4().hex``. Fixed length and charset, which is what lets
#: :func:`classify_key` decide whether a key segment IS an install id rather than
#: an ordinary folder name someone created in the console.
_INSTALL_ID_RE = re.compile(r"^[0-9a-f]{32}$")

#: The label sidecar each install writes at its OWN archive prefix
#: (``snapshots/<install>/_label.json``), so another install can render a name
#: instead of hex. It sits with the archives it labels, which means the same
#: listing that enumerates those archives also reveals whether a label exists --
#: no extra probe to find out, and one GET only for an install whose rows are
#: actually being displayed.
#:
#: The leading underscore is load-bearing twice over. It keeps the sidecar out of
#: the archive rows by a rule rather than by a name comparison, and
#: ``storage.validate_key`` requires a segment to START alphanumeric -- so this
#: object cannot be named by any request that comes through the drive or restore
#: routes, which validate every caller-supplied key.
LABEL_OBJECT_NAME = "_label.json"

#: Ceiling on a rendered label. A label written by ANOTHER install is
#: foreign-authored text arriving through the same door object names arrive
#: through, so it is bounded before it is rendered; the row it lands in is one
#: line of 12px caption.
LABEL_MAX_CHARS = 64

#: How many OTHER installs' prefixes one expanded listing will enumerate.
#:
#: A RUNAWAY BOUND, not a display choice, and the distinction is what makes the
#: number this large. An earlier draft capped this at 8 and picked the shown
#: subset with ``sorted(other_ids)[:8]`` -- hex order, which is arbitrary with
#: respect to recency, so a stale prefix (a reinstall, or the process-local
#: fallback id minting a fresh one per restart) could displace the install
#: holding the newest surviving archive. That is a coin flip on exactly the
#: replacement-machine path this expansion exists for. Set high enough that
#: truncation cannot bite a real drive, the subset stops being a decision at all:
#: every install present is listed, and which one sorts first only affects the
#: order rows appear in, which the timestamp sort then fixes anyway.
#:
#: Each install still costs a list call per kind plus at most one label read, all
#: on the owner's bill -- which is why the whole expansion is opt-in. What this
#: bound protects is the pathological case, not the ordinary one: two machines is
#: what the feature is for.
MAX_OTHER_INSTALLS = 32

#: Where an archive came from, as the listing and the restore reply name it.
#:
#: ``legacy`` is not a synonym for "somebody else's": it means the key predates
#: the namespace and carries no id at all, so its origin is genuinely UNKNOWN.
#: It is rendered as unknown for that reason and never claimed as this install's.
ORIGIN_SELF = "self"
ORIGIN_OTHER = "other"
ORIGIN_LEGACY = "legacy"

#: An archive sitting under THIS install's prefix that this install has no record
#: of uploading.
#:
#: The prefix alone cannot prove ownership, and that is not a detail. An install id
#: is a random 32 hex, but it is carried as a KEY PREFIX, which makes it a folder
#: name anyone who can list the bucket can read -- and a bucket the feature shares
#: by design has other writers. So a co-writer can list the prefixes and PUT an
#: archive under this install's own, and a gate that trusted the prefix would then
#: hand that archive back with no confirmation at all. "The id is the one part
#: another install cannot restate" is true of a READER and false of a WRITER.
#:
#: What this install genuinely knows is which keys IT uploaded, because it wrote
#: them down: :func:`_record_run` records every successful push in state that the
#: shared agent file-tool fence already protects. So ``self`` now means "in that
#: record" and nothing weaker, and everything else under the prefix is this --
#: probably ours, not provably ours, and therefore refused by
#: :func:`restore_download` without an explicit override, exactly like an archive
#: that carries no id at all. The refusal is in the BACKEND on purpose: a
#: confirmation dialog only binds the client that shows it.
ORIGIN_UNVERIFIED = "unverified"

#: How many of this install's own uploaded keys are remembered per account. The
#: panel lists 20 per kind, so this covers a long history of both kinds while
#: keeping the state document bounded; the oldest entry is dropped when a new
#: upload arrives. Falling off the end is not a correctness problem -- an archive
#: whose record has aged out reads as :data:`ORIGIN_UNVERIFIED` and asks, which is
#: the safe direction to fail in.
#:
#: It bounds ``uploads`` ONLY. ``upload_versions`` is bounded separately, because
#: the two maps answer questions with different lifetimes; see
#: :data:`MAX_RECORDED_VERSIONS`.
MAX_REMEMBERED_UPLOADS = 200

#: The BACKSTOP on ``upload_versions``, and deliberately not a horizon.
#:
#: A version record is the only thing that lets a sweep retire an archive, so while
#: this map was trimmed to the keys ``uploads`` still held, a count chosen for a
#: PANEL decided what retention could ever collect. An install pushing nightly with
#: retention off -- the shipped default -- dropped its oldest version record at push
#: 201, and a ``keep`` count enabled later could not reach anything older: those
#: archives held no recorded version, the ownership test refused them, and their
#: bytes were billed permanently. The bound kept MINTING that floor.
#:
#: So the record's lifetime is now the ARCHIVE's, not the panel's:
#: :func:`_prune_recorded_versions` drops a record when a listing the sweep trusted
#: proves the object is gone, and this number is only the ceiling that stops a
#: pathological document growing without limit. A healthy install never reaches it,
#: because retention itself bounds the pile once enabled and the prune tracks it.
#:
#: 5000 keys, which at two nightly kinds is about six and a half years, and which
#: sits under what the sweep could act on anyway: ``storage.list_object_versions``
#: refuses a prefix holding more than ten full delete batches of version rows, so a
#: larger record cap would name archives retention can never enumerate. At roughly
#: 130 bytes per entry the ceiling is a state document under a megabyte.
#:
#: Overflow drops the OLDEST records, which is the only safe direction: the newest
#: archives are the ones a ``keep`` count protects, and a dropped record never
#: deletes anything -- it only returns that archive to the unreclaimable floor
#: :func:`retention_unrecorded` reports.
MAX_RECORDED_VERSIONS = 5000

#: Longest staged filename, in bytes. ``NAME_MAX`` is 255 on ext4 and on the other
#: filesystems this app is deployed to, and a key segment is capped at 255 characters
#: upstream, so a prefix added to a basename can otherwise overrun it and the restore
#: fails with ``ENAMETOOLONG`` instead of producing a file.
STAGING_NAME_MAX_BYTES = 255

#: Subpath per backup kind. One place, because three call sites (upload, listing,
#: key classification) have to agree on it or the namespace splits.
KIND_SUBPATHS: dict[str, str] = {KIND_SNAPSHOT: "snapshots", KIND_SESSIONS: "sessions"}

#: The reverse of :data:`KIND_SUBPATHS`, for attributing a recorded key back to
#: the kind that wrote it. DERIVED rather than written out a second time, so a
#: kind added to the table above cannot be missing from this one -- a missing
#: entry would not raise, it would silently leave that kind's archives
#: uncounted.
_KIND_BY_SUBPATH: dict[str, str] = {sub: kind for kind, sub in KIND_SUBPATHS.items()}

#: The floor, and not a style choice: at ``keep=0`` the sweep would delete the
#: archive the run has just uploaded, so a backup would end by destroying itself.
#: Every configured value is clamped through :func:`_clamp_retention_keep`. The
#: newest complete archive is protected SEPARATELY from this floor, because a floor
#: is a property of the number and the protection must not depend on the number.
RETENTION_KEEP_MIN = 1

#: Where the count lives in ``backup.json``, and the whole switch: this key present
#: and holding a usable count is the only thing that enables retention. Absent, or
#: holding anything else, means keep everything -- there is no default that deletes.
#:
#: Deleting an object version cannot be undone, and these are the operator's bytes
#: in the operator's bucket, so the two ways of being wrong do not compare. Shipping
#: off costs storage an operator can see in a listing and fix with one command;
#: shipping on silently destroys archives somebody was deliberately keeping and
#: leaves them nothing to restore from. It is also the house shape for this kind of
#: switch rather than a new policy: ``nightly`` ships off, reads fail-closed, and is
#: never inferred from an adjacent grant. Retention defaulting to delete would be
#: the first capability here to act destructively on operator data unasked.
#:
#: Read only through :func:`_retention_keep_for_sweep`, never inferred from
#: ``nightly`` or any other grant in either direction: authorizing unattended
#: UPLOADS is not authorizing permanent DELETES.
#:
#: Per ACCOUNT, because the drive is per account: two connected accounts are two
#: buckets and two bills, and one number for both would apply a decision made about
#: one to the other.
RETENTION_KEEP_STATE_KEY = "retention_keep"

#: Where the last sweep's unclaimed measurement lives in ``backup.json``: per account,
#: then per kind, ``{"archives": int, "bytes": int, "at": iso8601}``.
#:
#: An archive holds a ``keep`` slot only while its version id is recorded, so a key this
#: install remembers with no recorded version -- pushed before the record existed, an
#: unversioned bucket, a put response naming none -- can never be retired, and its bytes
#: are billed permanently. The sweep already measures that floor, but the two numbers
#: reached only :data:`SEL_OP_RETENTION` and a log line -- neither of which an operator
#: reads while deciding whether retention is bounding their bill. So the floor belongs
#: where the count itself is read.
#:
#: It is a floor ON THE REMEMBERED SET, not over the whole prefix. The sweep counts only
#: keys in :func:`retention_owned_keys`, so a key with neither an ``uploads`` entry nor a
#: version record is filtered out before this measurement and reads 0 here however many
#: bytes it holds. That is the contract rather than an omission: counting such a key
#: here would mean attributing an object this install has no record of, and this pair is
#: read against the ``keep`` count to see what retention will collect out of the set it
#: can see. Those keys are counted separately and claim nothing -- see
#: :data:`RETENTION_UNRECORDED_STATE_KEY`, which reaches the same status read and the
#: same audit event.
#:
#: Stamped because it is the LAST SWEEP's measurement and not a live read: a manual
#: :func:`storage.delete_key` between sweeps leaves the number high until the next one,
#: and a reader cannot tell a stale number from a current one without knowing when it
#: was taken.
RETENTION_UNCLAIMED_STATE_KEY = "retention_unclaimed"

#: Where the last sweep's count of LISTED-BUT-UNRECORDED objects lives in
#: ``backup.json``: per account, then per kind,
#: ``{"objects": int, "bytes": int, "at": iso8601}``.
#:
#: This pair makes NO ownership claim and NO reclaim claim, and the wording is the
#: contract rather than caution. It counts objects the listing showed under this
#: kind's ``<subpath>/<install id>/`` folder that this install holds no record of --
#: neither an ``uploads`` entry nor a version record. Two different things land in
#: it and nothing here can tell them apart: this install's own archives whose
#: records aged out before :data:`MAX_RECORDED_VERSIONS` gave them the archive's
#: lifetime, and objects some other writer put under a prefix that is co-writable by
#: design. So it is ``objects``, never ``archives``: calling them archives would
#: assert they are ours, and the install id in the key is a string any co-writer can
#: type.
#:
#: Nothing acts on this number. The sweep counts these keys and then skips them
#: exactly as before -- they never enter ``by_key``, never hold a ``keep`` slot, and
#: are never deleted. It is reported because an operator who enables a keep count to
#: bound their bill needs to see the bytes that count will not touch, and because
#: :data:`RETENTION_UNCLAIMED_STATE_KEY` deliberately reads 0 for them: that pair is
#: a floor on the REMEMBERED set and these keys are filtered out before it is taken.
#: Two numbers with two meanings, rather than one number that means neither.
#:
#: Whether any of these could be adopted and reclaimed is a separate design that
#: owes its own argument about proof, and this field is deliberately not a step
#: toward it: a count needs no proof of ownership because it erases nothing.
#:
#: Stamped, and written under the same trusted-listing gate as the pair above, for
#: the same reason: a listing the sweep refused to trust about age cannot be trusted
#: about what it omitted either.
RETENTION_UNRECORDED_STATE_KEY = "retention_unrecorded"

#: How long a completed run keeps the nightly quiet, in seconds. Named rather than
#: inlined because :data:`NIGHTLY_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECS` is bounded BY it: a retry delay
#: that reached this would be indistinguishable from the nightly not being due at all,
#: so the two numbers have to be comparable in one place instead of one being a literal
#: inside :func:`_a_day_since_last_run` and the other a literal here.
NIGHTLY_WINDOW_SECS = 23 * 3600

#: Where a FAILED unattended attempt is recorded in ``backup.json``: per account, then
#: per kind, ``{"at": iso8601, "since": iso8601, "consecutive": int, "error": str}``.
#:
#: A separate key from ``runs`` on purpose, and the separation is the whole design.
#: ``runs`` is a record of bytes that reached the drive: :func:`uploaded_versions`,
#: :func:`_unchanged_baseline` and the retention sweep all read it as proof an archive
#: exists. A failed attempt proves the opposite, so filing it there would hand every one
#: of those readers a baseline to compare against and a version to retire for an upload
#: that never happened. Here it is read by exactly one consumer -- the due-check -- and
#: by the status projection that reports it.
NIGHTLY_FAILURE_STATE_KEY = "nightly_failures"

#: The wait after N consecutive failed unattended attempts, indexed by N-1, with the
#: last entry as the ceiling for anything beyond.
#:
#: The FIRST entry is zero deliberately. A single failure is not yet evidence of a
#: pattern, and retrying it on the next wake is the behaviour the reported issue calls
#: correct for a transient fault; backing off from the SECOND failure is the first point
#: at which the loop has seen the fault twice. So nothing about a one-off blip changes.
#:
#: The ceiling is what makes this a backoff rather than a mute. It is asserted below to
#: sit under :data:`NIGHTLY_WINDOW_SECS`, so however long a deterministic fault persists
#: the loop still attempts more often than once a window -- a backoff must never become
#: a second way for a backup the owner enabled to go quiet, which is the same rule
#: :func:`_a_day_since_last_run` follows when it reads an unparseable stamp as due.
#:
#: With the half-hourly wake this takes a permanent fault from roughly 48 attempts a day
#: to 2, and the first day from 48 to 6.

    a co-writer can overwrite an archive after it was recorded, and a check that
    only matched keys would hand back their bytes as ours.

    A fingerprint closes that, and it closes it WITHOUT depending on anything S3
    reports. This is taken twice over local bytes: once over the file this install
    uploads, and once over the file a restore has finished downloading. The restore

def _tree_fingerprint(
    archive: Path | None = None, *, volatile_root: bool, fd: int | None = None
) -> str:
    """A digest of what an archive CARRIES, stable across two builds of one tree.

    This is the value the unchanged-check compares, and it exists because
    :func:`_body_fingerprint` cannot answer the question. A ``tar.gz`` embeds a
    per-entry mtime and a gzip header stamp, so two runs over a byte-identical tree
    produce different archive bytes -- measured, and pinned by a test. An
    archive-level comparison therefore reports "changed" every single night and a skip
    built on it could never fire.

    So the digest is taken over the ENTRY SET instead: for every member, its path,
    its kind, its permission mode, its size and a hash of its bytes, accumulated in
    sorted path order. That is the per-entry source manifest the decision needs, read
    from the packed copy.

    Reading it from the packed copy rather than walking the source again is
    deliberate, and it is the stronger of the two:

    * It cannot drift. A second walk would have to re-derive WHICH paths each kind
      packs -- knowledge that lives in ``snapshot.COMPONENTS`` and in
      :func:`_add_tree` -- and the day the two disagreed, the manifest would answer
      "unchanged" for a tree whose real content had moved. A backup that silently
      stops backing up is a worse failure than a local rebuild.
    * It sees redaction. The snapshot path may upload a redacted copy
      (:func:`snapshot.prepare_redacted_copy`), so flipping that switch changes the
      bytes that LEAVE while the source tree is untouched. Taken over the payload,
      this notices; taken over the source, it would not.

    ``mtime`` is deliberately NOT part of the digest even though a source manifest
    conventionally carries it. It is not needed -- a content change moves the content
    hash -- and it is actively harmful here: a restore, a ``touch``, or a checkout
    bumps mtime without changing a byte, and the resulting "changed" verdict would
    spend the full upload this check exists to avoid. (``MANIFEST.json``'s mtime is
    also rewritten on every build, measured.)

    *volatile_root* strips the first path segment from every member. The snapshot
    bundle's root directory is named ``kirocrew-snapshot-<stamp>``, so it changes every
    run and would defeat the comparison on its own; the bundle has exactly one root,
    which ``snapshot._redacted_upload_copy`` already depends on and enforces. The
    sessions archive is the opposite case -- its roots are ``crew`` and ``cli``, which
    are meaningful -- so its caller passes ``False`` and nothing is stripped. Each
    caller states what it knows about its own archive rather than this guessing from a
    name pattern.

    ``usedforsecurity`` is not passed: unlike :func:`_body_fingerprint` this is
    SHA-256, which no hardened build refuses.

    *fd* reads the entry set from an open descriptor rather than from *archive*'s
    name, for the reason :func:`_body_fingerprint` gives: this digest is what
    decides whether to upload at all, so it must describe the file that is then
    uploaded rather than a second resolution of the same string.

    Returns ``""`` when the archive cannot be read as a ``tar.gz`` at all, and an empty
    value never matches anything, so the run uploads. This function deliberately does
    NOT turn an unreadable payload into a refusal: validating the archive is a separate
    question from deciding whether to send it, and raising here would decide the first
    one on the way past. An unreadable payload is pushed, exactly as a payload this
    cannot read has to be; the skip is the only thing unavailable for it.

    A refusal is the outcome an auditor most wants evidence of, and it was the

    authorization decision off the audited path with it: the route's audit has
    already recorded ``successful`` by the time a worker thread reaches
    ``put_file``, and the Job SDK only records that the run ``failed``. To a
    reader scanning SEL events for denials, a real denial looked like nothing at
    all.

    The event shape is the one this app already uses for a refused mutation
    (``routes._audit`` -> ``sel().log_api_access``) rather than a second
    convention for the same kind of decision. It is emitted HERE, at the
    decision, and not in the Job SDK runner: ``_authorize_upload`` is also
    reached from the nightly loop in ``hooks.py``, and a runner-level catch would
    leave that path unaudited.

    ``caller`` is passed in rather than assumed, because covering the nightly path
    is exactly what makes a hardcoded interactive caller a lie: an unattended run
    refused at 03:00 must not be recorded against the dashboard owner. Each entry
    point states its own (``CALLER_OWNER`` / ``CALLER_SCHEDULED``), so attribution
    stays true on both instead of being flattened to a neutral string that is
    honest for one path and lossy for the other.

    ``outcome`` is ``denied`` for the access decisions and ``failed`` for
    teardown. Every refusal leaves a record -- one covered path among several
    would make the rest look like non-events -- but a routine restart is not an
    access decision, and filing it as ``denied`` would put it in the same bucket
    as a withdrawn consent and devalue every real denial in the log. Both values
    are from the vocabulary ``sel.py`` documents for this field.

    ``operation`` names WHICH decision was refused, because the same gate now
    guards two of them: the archive upload, and the retention sweep that follows
    a successful one. They must not share a name -- a refused sweep filed as a
    denied upload is a denial recorded against a transfer that completed. See
    :data:`SEL_OP_UPLOAD` and :data:`SEL_OP_RETENTION`.

    This is what makes :data:`MAX_RECORDED_VERSIONS` a backstop rather than a horizon.
    A record lives as long as its archive does and this is the only thing that ends it,
    so no count chosen to bound a panel decides what retention is able to retire.

    It deletes STATE, never an object, so the failure directions are not symmetric. A
    record wrongly kept costs a little document space and nothing else -- the archive
    still has to pass :func:`_current_version_is_ours` before anything touches it. A
    record wrongly dropped returns its archive to the unreclaimable floor, which costs
    bytes but destroys nothing. Neither direction can erase data, and the prune is
    written to prefer keeping.

    Three bounds make the absence a PROOF rather than a guess:

    * The caller runs this only past the gate that accepted the listing as showing the
      archive this run just uploaded. ``storage.list_object_versions`` walks the whole
      token chain and RAISES rather than returning a partial answer, so a listing that
      got here is complete for its prefix. A listing that raised, or that the gate
      refused, never reaches this function and prunes nothing.
    * Only records under ``<kind subpath>/<install id>/`` are eligible. The listing saw
      exactly that folder, so it is evidence about nothing else: a snapshot sweep must
      not prune a sessions record, and no sweep may prune another install's.
    * Only records in ``eligible`` -- the ownership set read BEFORE the listing began --
      are eligible. A push that lands while the listing is in flight legitimately names
      an object the listing does not show, and a manual run racing the nightly loop is
      a documented case rather than a hypothetical one.

    The in-process records of pushes whose state write failed are untouched: this
    writes through :func:`_locked_state_update`, which mutates only the persisted
    document, and :func:`_merge_pending` carries those records back in afterwards.
    Their archives are in the bucket, so the listing shows them anyway.

    That holds only because a held record is RELEASED once the document carries it.
    :func:`_release_persisted_versions` is what makes it true: without it a held version
    outliving its fingerprint would be carried back after this prune deleted it, on
    every later update, and this function's deletion would be temporary rather than a
    decision.

    Without this the drive only ever grows. Both push paths mint a key carrying
    :func:`_stamp`, so nothing is ever overwritten and a nightly backup adds one
    archive a night forever -- measured on a real drive: 15 snapshot archives,
    10.1 GB, the newest 2.49 GB, oldest three weeks old, on a bucket whose size
    had never once gone down.

    **Deleting the OBJECT would not have helped.** The drive has versioning
    enabled and no lifecycle rule, so ``delete-object`` without a version id
    writes a delete marker and leaves the bytes as a noncurrent version that goes
    on being billed -- a retention pass built that way would empty the listing
    and save nothing. So the sweep is version-aware end to end: it lists versions
    (:func:`storage.list_object_versions`) and deletes them pinned to their
    ``VersionId`` (:func:`storage.delete_object_versions`), which erases the bytes
    and leaves no marker behind.

    **BEST-EFFORT AND LAST.** The upload is the point of the run; retention is
    housekeeping after it. Every failure below is caught and logged as one line,
    because a backup whose archive is safely off-host must never be reported as
    failed over a cleanup that was not -- the only cost of a skipped sweep is a
    bill, and the next successful run collects it.

    **AUDITED EITHER WAY.** Being best-effort is why the SEL entry matters: a
    failure that only logs is a failure nobody reviewing the audit trail can see,
    and this is the one path in the app that erases object versions for good. So
    every terminal outcome files one event through :func:`_audit_retention` --
    including the ones that deleted nothing -- while a refusal by the gate is left
    to :func:`_refuse_upload`, which already recorded it where the decision was
    made.

    Three scoping rules, each made load-bearing by the shape of this bucket:

    * **Per install.** One drive is reachable by several installs BY DESIGN (see
      "install identity"), so the listing and every delete are anchored on THIS
      install's prefix. Another machine's archives are not ours to retire and its
      retention setting is not ours to apply.
    * **Per kind.** ``snapshots/`` and ``sessions/`` are separate histories with
      separate cadences. Counted together, a burst of one kind would evict the
      other kind's only copy.
    * **Never the newest, whatever the count.** The key this run just uploaded is
      dropped from the candidates unconditionally, by name, and that is a SEPARATE
      guarantee from the count rather than a consequence of it. The floor at
      :data:`RETENTION_KEEP_MIN` also happens to spare the first entry of the age
      order, but the two are not the same claim: the run's own key is only first in
      that order while nothing else carries a later timestamp, and a co-writer with
      a skewed clock or a future-dated object is enough to move it. Tying the
      guarantee to the number would make it hold by luck exactly when the ordering
      surprises us, which is the case it exists for.

    And one refusal, which is the cloud form of the guard ``--keep`` already
    carries locally: a bundle that omits data it was asked to carry does not
    prune, so an incomplete backup cannot replace a complete one. Here, if the
    listing does not show the archive this run just uploaded, NOTHING is pruned. A
    view missing the newest object is a view that cannot be trusted about which
    objects are old, and acting on one is how a retention pass deletes the history
    and keeps nothing.

    Returns a record of what it did, for the log line and for tests. Callers
    ignore it: there is no outcome here that should change the run's own result.

    the reader, and the only channel between two installs is the bucket.

    **Takes its own authorization, once per PUT.** An authorization is only good
    for the write that immediately follows it: any S3 round trip in between is time
    in which consent can be withdrawn, so a single gate covering two uploads leaves
    the second one running on a decision that has expired. Ordering the writes

    backup of only one kind would leave the other prefix holding the old name and
    the reader could keep showing it. Writing both keeps every copy current, and

    Never raises. A backup that reached the bucket must not be reported as failed

    Returning the matched RECORD rather than a bool is what lets the caller record a
    skip that carries the baseline's own key, body fingerprint and version, so the
    baseline survives for tomorrow's comparison instead of being replaced by a run that
    points at nothing.

    Every branch that is not a proven match returns ``None``, which means UPLOAD. That
    direction is the only safe one: a needless upload costs one archive, while a skip
    taken on weak evidence means the operator's newest data is not off-host and nothing
    says so. Concretely, all of these upload:

    * No tree fingerprint for this run, or none recorded on the prior run -- an install
      upgraded into this feature has no baseline, and unknown is not a pass. The same
      rule the rest of this module applies to an empty body fingerprint.
    * The fingerprints differ: the tree moved, which is the whole point.
    * The prior run recorded no key, so there is nothing to prove.
    * The recorded object is GONE. A record proves this install wrote the key once, not
      that anything is there now -- and retention deletes by design, so a baseline
      ageing out of the keep window is an ordinary occurrence, not an exotic one. A
      skip against a deleted archive would leave the drive holding nothing for this
      kind while every run reported success.
    * The object at the recorded key is not the VERSION this install wrote. See below.
    * Its length is not the length we uploaded either -- a second, independent reading
      of the same question, kept because it costs nothing and does not depend on the
      bucket being versioned.
    * The HEAD could not be answered at all -- a throttle, a timeout, a credential
      lapse, an owner-pin refusal. ``head_object_meta`` raises rather than folding those
      into "absent", so this catches them and treats them as unproven.

    **Identity is the VERSION, not the length.** One drive is reachable by several
    installs by design, so a co-writer can overwrite a recorded key -- and an overwrite
    that happens to match the recorded byte length would pass a length-only check. The
    skip would then hold, uploads would stop while the tree was unchanged, and the
    object a restore fetches first would be the foreign one: ``restore_download`` reads
    the key's CURRENT version, so its fingerprint check rejects that object. Since
    :func:`_recover_recorded_version` the restore then makes one more read, of the
    version this install recorded, so there IS now an automated path back to our bytes
    -- but it depends on a provable recorded version, and the very buckets that make
    this failure likely are the ones that supply none (see the unversioned and
    suspended cases below). A skip must therefore not lean on it: silent stopped
    backups whose recovery is conditional is still the outcome worth spending a
    comparison to avoid, so the current version must be the one we recorded writing.
    This is the same question :func:`_current_version_is_ours` answers for retention,
    asked here of one key.

    A consequence worth stating: on an UNVERSIONED bucket no version is recorded and
    the HEAD names none, and on a SUSPENDED one both sides report ``"null"``, which
    names a version slot rather than one version. Neither can be shown to be ours, so
    the skip never fires there. That is deliberate and matches how retention already
    reads a missing version -- absence is "do not touch" -- and the app creates its
    drive with versioning on, so the cost falls on a bucket this product did not make.

    **The probe is authorized.** The ``head-object`` is a request to a paid service on
    the operator's account, and an archive build runs for minutes, so consent can be
    withdrawn or the app disabled between the run starting and this point. The gate is
    re-taken immediately before the HEAD under its own operation name
    (:data:`SEL_OP_BASELINE_PROBE`), which leaves the pre-PUT re-check at the push
    untouched: that one still guards the bytes leaving, and this one guards the metadata
    read. Deliberately placed AFTER the local checks above, so a run that could not skip
    anyway spends no round trip discovering it.

    first ordinary unchanged run quietly restore an assertion of complete coverage
    over a run that had reported a gap. The caller measures them on every run,
    including this one, so forwarding the CURRENT answer is also more correct than
    preserving the old one.

#: The operator's standing permission for the sessions archive to carry Layer B --
#: the byte-exact, unredacted kiro-cli context window (``<sid>.json`` +
#: ``<sid>.jsonl`` under :func:`kiro_sessions_dir`), and the table-scoped export
#: of the terminal's own conversation store (the ``conversations/`` root, see
#: :func:`_export_cli_conversations`). Both are what a model actually held,
#: unredacted, which is the property this permission prices, so one permission
#: covers both and neither has a second path around it. Default OFF, so an archive
#: carries the crew transcript half only unless the operator has chosen otherwise.
#:
#: Why a gate here at all. Layer B is strictly more sensitive than the transcript
#: it accompanies: the transcript is what was DISPLAYED, with display-time
#: redaction applied, while Layer B is what the model actually held, unredacted.
#: It also cannot be redacted on the way out -- the thinking blocks inside it
#: carry a provider signature over their own content, so rewriting one invalidates
#: the conversation -- which leaves exactly two choices, byte-exact or absent.
#: ``dashboard.export_include_layer_b`` puts the same choice in the operator's
#: hands for the file-export path, but this permission is deliberately NOT a
#: ``config.json`` key like that one.
#:
#: WHY NOT ``config.json``. That file is writable by any auto-approved agent
#: shell, so a permission stored there is one a prompt-injected agent can grant
#: itself: edit the key, wait for the owner to run a sessions backup, and the
#: unredacted context uploads with no consent -- an outcome nothing can recall,
#: because an object already in a bucket cannot be un-sent. An authorization
#: whose subject can write it is not an authorization. The repo's own
#: ``CredentialPolicy.exempt_exact_hosts`` docstring states the rule: such a
#: value is "NEVER sourced from ``config.json``". So this one lives in the app's
#: state document, ``backup.json``, which sits inside the already-fenced
#: :data:`STATE_DIR_LEAF` directory on the read+write keystone floor
#: (``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``) -- the same placement, and for the same
#: reason, as the ``nightly`` bit beside it, which authorizes unattended PAID
#: uploads. An agent can write no path in that directory, and the only writer is
#: the owner-gated ``POST /backup/{account}/layer-b`` handler, which opens the
#: file directly rather than through the agent tool gate, so the operator's
#: toggle still works.
#:
#: PER ACCOUNT, like ``nightly`` and unlike the export key, because the risk this
#: permission prices is the destination: the archive lands in one account's
#: bucket, so granting it for that bucket must not grant it for another the
#: operator adds later.
#:
#: Default OFF rather than ON, even though the destination is the operator's own
#: bucket, because the bucket is not provably a single operator's: this app
#: supports several installs writing one drive and says so
#: (:data:`ORIGIN_UNVERIFIED` exists because "anyone who can write to the bucket
#: can write to a name"), so a co-writer can reach an archive here. Being wrong
#: in the OFF direction costs a restore its full-fidelity resume until the
#: operator flips one toggle, and the run record states that it happened. Being
#: wrong in the ON direction puts unredacted context somewhere it cannot be
#: recalled from. Only one of those is recoverable.
#:
#: An unreadable state file or a non-boolean value reads as OFF, for the reason
#: :func:`nightly_enabled` gives for the same posture: a document this function
#: cannot understand must not widen what leaves the machine, and a backup that
#: still runs without Layer B is better than one that fails.

    r"""This host's kiro-cli store, and why there is none when there is none.

    Resolved through :func:`identity_stores.state_db_candidates` against FIXED,
    home-anchored locations. The environment is deliberately NOT consulted -- not
    ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` on POSIX, not ``LOCALAPPDATA`` or ``APPDATA`` on Windows --
    which is why an empty mapping is passed rather than ``os.environ``.

    **Why a relocated store is skipped rather than found.** The fence that makes
    this store unreadable and unwritable by agent file tools is home-anchored:
    ``security.paths`` splices in :func:`identity_stores.fenced_home_dirs`, and its
    own comment records that "a profile redirected outside the home directory is
    not covered". So a store re-rooted by one of those variables sits OUTSIDE the
    fence, where an agent can author rows. This function feeds an archive that is
    uploaded off-host unattended, so honouring the variable would let an agent
    plant rows in a ``conversations_v2`` table at a location it may write and have
    a scheduled backup ship them. An uploaded object cannot be un-sent.
    :func:`kiro_prerequisite` records the same decision for the same two variables
    and states the rule this follows: a fixed anchor cannot be pointed at
    something the agent may write. Being wrong in this direction costs a
    relocated-store install its terminal conversations, which the run record shows
    as an absent ``conversations/`` root; being wrong in the other direction
    uploads agent-authored content and cannot be undone.

    The candidates come back current-platform, most likely first, deduped; the
    first that is a regular file reached through no redirection is this host's.

    **The second return value says WHY no store was used, and it is never empty when
    none was.** It is a reason string, and the caller suppresses the retention sweep on
    any reason, so each of these cases keeps an earlier archive alive rather than
    letting this run retire it. Three cases reach it, and none is exotic:
    ``store_rejected_link`` for a candidate refused by either redirection test -- and
    the ancestor walk rejects on ANY parent from ``/`` down, including the home
    directory, so an ordinary symlinked ``~/.local/share`` or a symlinked home takes
    this exit permanently -- ``store_unreadable`` for one whose stat raised ``OSError``,
    and ``store_absent`` when nothing is at any fenced location.

    Absence reports a reason for a reason worth stating, since the opposite reads as
    obvious: the question the caller asks is whether an EARLIER archive holds rows this
    one does not, which is about backup history rather than about what is on disk now. A
    store wiped to clear corruption, removed by a reinstall, or on a volume not mounted
    at nightly-run time was present when last week's archive was written. Nothing pins a
    store's presence from one run to the next, so a per-run observation cannot answer
    the question, and answering it optimistically erases the last archive that held the
    conversations.

    **The ORDER of the two redirection tests and the file test is the guard, not a
    detail.** ``is_file()`` on a LOCAL-looking path whose ANCESTOR is a junction to
    ``\\host\share`` opens an outbound SMB connection that authenticates as this
    process, and it does so inside the stat itself -- before any check of ours can
    reject anything. So the ancestor walk runs FIRST, on every candidate, before
    the path is stat-ed at all. :func:`platform_compat.first_linked_ancestor` tests
    ancestors root-first and stops at the first link, so the walk never traverses
    one either. It deliberately excludes the leaf, which is why
    :func:`platform_compat.is_link_or_junction` still tests the candidate itself:
    ``islink`` alone answers False for a Windows junction, so a bare symlink check
    would accept a junction and read the store it points at instead of this host's.
    A fixed anchor bounds where a candidate may live; it does not stop a link
    planted AT that anchor from redirecting the read, so both guards are needed.

    :func:`_kiro_cli_conversation_db` deliberately reads only fixed, home-anchored
    candidates, so a relocated store is skipped. Skipping it SILENTLY is the
    failure this answers: an operator whose store lives outside home would believe
    an archive holds their terminal conversations when it holds none, and nothing in
    the run record would say otherwise.

    Compares the two candidate sets by PATH and touches the filesystem not at all --
    no ``stat``, no open, nothing. That is deliberate rather than incidental: the
    relocated root is outside the agent-file-tool fence, and probing a path there is
    the very thing the ancestor guard in :func:`_kiro_cli_conversation_db` exists to
    stop. A set difference needs no probe, so this reports the condition without
    reproducing the risk.

    True means "the environment names at least one store location this export will
    not read". It does NOT mean a store exists there; that question cannot be
    answered without a probe, and is not worth one. Reporting the relocation is
    enough for an operator to understand an absent ``conversations/`` root, which is
    the whole job.

    **Only a variable that MOVES a candidate counts, and that is the whole test.**
    ``LOCALAPPDATA`` and ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` re-root their own candidate, so the
    difference sees them. ``APPDATA`` does not, and is deliberately not compared: the
    Windows Roaming candidate is a fixed home anchor because
    :func:`identity_stores.state_db_candidates` does not follow that variable -- "the
    current generation writes the ``LOCALAPPDATA`` location, and the roaming default
    is retained only as a legacy fallback". A store kiro-cli does not write to cannot
    be relocated away from this export, so an ``APPDATA`` mismatch is not evidence of
    a relocation. Comparing it anyway reported one on any host with a redirected
    Roaming folder, which is an ordinary enterprise configuration, and that false
    positive froze retention permanently while a readable Local store sat beside it
    inside the fence. Nothing is lost by leaving it out: a legacy install that really
    does keep its store at a redirected Roaming root has no store at either fixed
    candidate, so the lookup reports ``store_absent`` and the sweep is suppressed on

def _export_cli_conversations(tar: tarfile.TarFile) -> _ConversationExport:

    ``data.sqlite3`` is BOTH the terminal's conversation store and its identity
    auth store: ``hooks.py`` classifies the file as a token path and it
    holds live bearer tokens. Tar-ing the file would upload live
    credentials off-host, strictly worse than the gap this closes. So this reads
    the source and writes a FRESH database holding only :data:`_CONVERSATION_TABLES`
    -- an allowlist, so no byte of any table OUTSIDE it (no identity row, no token
    column of an auth table) can reach the archive even if kiro-cli adds a
    credential table later. The bound is per TABLE, not per column: every column an
    allowlisted table declares is copied, so a credential column added to
    ``conversations_v2`` itself would ride. See :func:`_copy_table`.

    **The source is a LIVE WAL-mode database, so a consistent read needs care.**
    A commit lands in the ``-wal`` sidecar and folds into the main file only on a
    checkpoint, so the main file and its ``-wal`` only agree at an instant. The
    safe read does NOT copy those files, and does NOT checkpoint: a checkpoint is
    a WRITE, and this opens the operator's store ``mode=ro``, on which a
    ``wal_checkpoint`` cannot run. What a read-only connection DOES give is a
    consistent WAL-aware view -- SQLite applies the committed ``-wal`` frames
    transparently on read -- so the whole export runs inside ONE explicit read
    transaction (``BEGIN``), which pins a single snapshot for the life of the
    copy. Every allowlisted table is then read against that one snapshot, so a
    writer committing mid-copy cannot make two tables disagree. This is why
    copying the ``-wal`` and then the main file separately would be wrong: it
    takes them at two different times, and a WAL copied before its commit was
    checkpointed replays over newer pages so the archive restores BACKWARDS.

    Steps:

    1. Open the source READ-ONLY (``mode=ro``) so this writes no database page and
       runs no checkpoint against the operator's live store. It is not a promise of
       zero filesystem writes: on a WAL store SQLite may still update the ``-shm``
       shared-memory sidecar to take a read mark, which is how a reader
       participates in WAL at all. The store's own DATA is what is untouchable
       here. Open one deferred read transaction so all reads share a single
       consistent snapshot including committed WAL frames.
    2. Copy the allowlisted tables through a named per-table column list, which
       fixes a stable column order for the copy -- see :func:`_copy_table` for what
       that does and does not bound, since the list is derived from the source's
       declared columns and is not a column allowlist. The fail-closed boundary is
       the TABLE allowlist in :data:`_CONVERSATION_TABLES`.

    Best-effort at the STORE level (a missing store, an unreadable one, a store that
    cannot be resolved at all) -- those
    return an empty :class:`_ConversationExport` and the sessions backup proceeds
    with the transcript halves. NOT
    best-effort at the ROW level: once a readable store is found, every row of
    every allowlisted table is copied and counted, and the manifest's count is
    asserted against the source in the tests, so a partial copy fails loudly
    rather than shipping a short archive.

    **One exit deliberately does NOT report a skip: a failure while WRITING the
    members into the tar.** ``tarfile.addfile`` raising part-way leaves the archive in
    an undefined state, so swallowing it would upload a damaged tarball under a record
    saying the run succeeded -- worse than the failure it hides, and the one case where
    losing the whole archive is the correct outcome. Everything before the first tar
    write is guarded and reports; from the first tar write onward, an
    exception propagates.

            # covers Layer B rather than consent.

            # Which path may skip it is decided by what is RE-READ inside the block, not
            # by `layer_b` alone. The recheck below short-circuits when `layer_b` is
            # False, so it contributes no second read there -- but `_authorize_upload`
            # re-reads the unattended grant for a SCHEDULED caller, and that grant's
            # setter (`set_nightly_sessions`) writes under this same sidecar lock. The
            # crew display half rides on every run, withheld or not, so a scheduled
            # withheld run still has a permission that can be withdrawn mid-block and a
            # payload that ships if the withdrawal is missed. It keeps the lock.
            #
            # The attended owner's withheld run is the one shape with neither: both
            # scheduled-only re-reads are skipped, the recheck short-circuits, and what
            # remains -- `is_app_enabled`, `aws_consent`, STS -- is not stored in this
            # module's state file and takes no lock of ours, so an exclusive hold would
            # order nothing. Taking none satisfies the invariant directly:
            # `_authorize_upload` and `put_file` sit adjacent with no blocking call
            # between them. Taking one costs what an exclusive hold costs -- the lock
            # file is `_state_path()`'s sidecar, one path for every account, so every
            # state writer of every account (`_record_run`, `set_sessions_layer_b`,
            # `set_retention_keep`, the nightly loop) waits out this upload up to
            # `_STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS` for a guarantee this one path does not need.
            # `contextlib.nullcontext` keeps that as one expression, so the body below
            # reads the same either way.
            #
            # `_upload_lock`, not `_state_lock`: the sidecar FILE lock alone, without
            # `_run_lock`. The setters (`set_sessions_layer_b` and `set_nightly_sessions`,
            # each -> `_locked_state_update` -> `_state_lock`) take this same file lock
            # exclusively, so an exclusive hold here still orders a revocation wholly
            # before or wholly after this block, in this process and in a second install
            # writing the same state -- the guarantee this gate exists for is untouched.
            # `_run_lock` ALSO
            # serializes `last_runs`, which the dashboard's backup-status read goes
            # through, so holding it across a PUT allowed `_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS` would
            # stall every account's status surface for one account's upload -- which is
            # why this block does not take it. Same shape, and same reason, as
            # `_delete_under_the_retention_gate`: it composes the sidecar file lock with
            # a dedicated gate rather than `_run_lock`, so a purge does not stall the
            # status read either.
            #
            # Nothing inside the block re-enters this lock. `_authorize_upload` reaches
            # `is_app_enabled`, `aws_consent`, an STS call, `_refuse_upload`, and -- for a
            # scheduled caller -- the unattended grant readers and
            # `scheduled_sessions_blocked_reason`. The last two READ this module's state
            # file, which is what the hold above orders them against, but they read it
            # without taking the lock, so naming them here costs no reentrancy. The list
            # is written out in full deliberately: a list that stops at STS reads as
            # though the withheld path has no permission left to lose, which is the
            # reasoning the hold above exists to refuse.
            #
            # The run record is written after the block. `_record_run` reaches the
            # same file lock through `_state_lock`, but only after this block has
            # released, and it holds no `_run_lock` while it waits for it -- so it
            # cannot deadlock against this block and it cannot drag the status read in
            # with it. Both halves of that are load-bearing: omitting `_run_lock` HERE
            # is not enough on its own, because the stall arrives through the contending
            # writer rather than through this block. See the lock-order note above
            # `_state_lock`. The
            # retention sweep takes the same FILE lock under `_RETENTION_GATE`, but it
            # runs after this block has released, not inside it.
            #
            # The cost, on the permitted path, is that a same-account revocation and the
            # nightly loop wait for the in-flight upload, bounded by
            # `_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS`. A revocation that appears slow is the price of one
            # that cannot be overtaken, and the exposure it prevents has no recovery.
            # What does NOT wait is every status read: `last_runs` and
            # `uploaded_objects` take only `_run_lock`, which neither this block nor a
            # writer parked on the file lock holds.
            # Stated in the positive and checked in the negative, so a caller nobody

            # operator withheld the permission -- a consented withdrawal, and the default,
            # so an ordinary install prunes exactly as it did before this feature existed.

            # been present when that archive was written. The accepted cost is narrow
            # because the permission is owner-gated and defaults off -- only a host that
            # opted INTO conversation backup and has no store to back up stops pruning, and

            # THE DECLINE IS AUDITED. Suppressing the sweep suppresses the DELETION, never
            # the record of the decision: `_audit_retention` is only reachable from inside
            # `_prune_remote_archives`, so an early return here would have filed no SEL
            # event at all, on the one path in the app that erases object versions for good
            # -- exactly the invisibility that function exists to prevent, and its contract
            # says every terminal outcome files one "including the ones that deleted
            # nothing". A decline is a terminal outcome. It is filed as `failed` with the
            # reason as `error`, matching the sweep's own refusal-to-act on a listing that
            # does not show the archive just uploaded: nothing was deleted and the operator
            # needs to know why, which is not the same as a withdrawn consent (`denied`
            # belongs to the gate). This is also what keeps the accumulation VISIBLE: while
            # the condition persists the archives pile up past the keep count, and one event
            # per run naming the reason is how an auditor sees that rather than inferring it
            # from a sweep that silently never ran.
            # TWO independent conditions, not one replacing the other. The first is this
            # run's own export coming up short, which is the `skipped` reason above. The
            # second is this run carrying no conversations at all while an older RETAINED
            # archive carries them -- which the grant's own scope can produce with nothing
            # wrong: an in-scope run uploads conversations, the scope is then narrowed, and
            # the next run's archive omits them while the sweep would retire the one that
            # holds them. That path sets no skip reason, because a scope the operator
            # narrowed is a policy decline rather than a failed read, so the first condition

def make_job_runner(sdk: Any, kind: str) -> Any:
    """Build the Job SDK runner for ``kind``. Registered once, at app startup.

    A PLAIN ``def``, and it must stay one. ``JobSDK._execute`` calls the runner
    and DISCARDS its return value, so an ``async def`` here would hand back a
    coroutine nobody awaits: the body would never execute, nothing would raise,
    and the record would settle on ``done`` reporting a backup that never
    happened. ``register()`` validates the kind and not the callable, so this
    property is the app's to keep.

    That constraint is what shapes the resolution below. The SDK gives a runner
    its handle and nothing else -- there is no ``params`` channel in P1 -- so the
    run's target is read back out of its own record, where ``start`` put it:

    * The ACCOUNT comes from ``dedupe_key``. It is the right carrier on its own
      merits, because the account is exactly this run's concurrency identity --
      two snapshot backups of one account must not both do the paid upload, and
      the SDK's index is ``(kind, dedupe_key)`` so snapshot and sessions for the
      same account still run independently. It is also the only field a runner
      can read without a private attribute (``get`` is public; the key is
      withheld from the HTTP view and never logged by the SDK).
    * profile/region/bucket are RE-RESOLVED here rather than carried, which is
      the rule this app already documents for the nightly loop: the drive is
      tag-discovered per run rather than trusted from memory.

    Every resolution step is therefore sync. ``accounts.resolve_account_profile``
    and ``aws_consent.authorize`` are coroutines and are NOT reachable from a
    worker thread -- ``asyncio.run`` would build a second event loop, which is
    the failure this package already carries a ``LoopBoundLock`` to avoid
    -- so this uses the sync cached resolver and lets the sync
    :func:`_authorize_upload` gate inside each runner make the paid-service
    decision. That gate is the real one: it re-checks the LIVE account against
    the target, that the app is still enabled, that S3 consent still holds for
    this profile+region, and that the recorded grant names THIS account, all
    immediately before ``put_file``. So a run started through the generic
    ``_jobs`` surface, which does not pass this app's HTTP pre-flight, is
    authorized by the same gate as one started through it.

    Refusals raise. ``_execute`` records the exception's text as the run's
    ``error`` and the status as ``failed``, which is the honest terminal state
    for a request that named no reachable target. The messages deliberately do
    NOT quote the dedupe key: it is caller-supplied, and the SDK withholds it
    from both the log and the HTTP view for that reason.

    """One bounded read of the version this install recorded, or ``None``.

    Called only when the object CURRENT at ``key`` failed the body fingerprint. That
    failure means a co-writer overwrote a key this install recorded -- the drive is
    reachable by every install pointed at the account, versioning is on for exactly
    that reason, and an overwrite leaves our bytes behind as a noncurrent version.
    Before this, no code path could ask for them: :func:`storage.get_file` named no
    version, so a restore read whatever was current and the operator's own archive
    sat on the drive, intact and unreachable.

    Returns a path to a temp file holding bytes that PASSED the same fingerprint,
    never a path to bytes that merely arrived. ``None`` means the caller should fall
    back to the refusal it would have raised anyway, so every uncertain branch
    returns ``None``:

    * No recorded fingerprint to compare against. An empty one matches nothing, and
      unknown is not a pass -- the same rule the rest of this module applies.
    * No recorded version for this key, or one that names a version SLOT rather
      than one version (see :func:`_is_provable_version_id`, which rejects
      ``"null"``: a suspended-versioning bucket gives that id to every write, so
      two different bodies at one key both report it).
    * A recorded version that is not well-formed enough to pass to the CLI at all
      (see :func:`storage.validate_version_id`).
    * The read is not authorized at the moment it would be made -- see
      :func:`_authorize_recovery_read`. The extra read is the one AWS call in a
      restore the caller did not ask for, so a disabled app, a withdrawn grant, a
      grant naming another account, or a profile repointed during the first download
      all stop it.
    * The version is gone -- deleted, expired out of the keep window, or never
      there. AWS answers with an error and it is reported as a refusal, not raised:
      for this caller an unusable recorded id is a refusal to report, not a fault.
    * The bytes came back and do NOT match the fingerprint. This is the case worth
      being precise about: it is not a recovery that failed, it is a second set of
      foreign bytes, and it is discarded exactly like the first.

    A fingerprint match is the WHOLE test, and nothing else is asked of the bytes.
    Whether they still open as a ``tar.gz`` is a different question, and one this
    module answers the same way everywhere: the current-version read accepts on the
    fingerprint alone, and the upload side pushes payloads it cannot read
    (:func:`_tree_fingerprint` returns ``""`` for an unreadable ``tar.gz``), so a
    recorded fingerprint can honestly name a malformed archive. Refusing one HERE
    would mean the operator gets their own archive when nobody overwrote the key and
    a refusal when somebody did, for the same bytes -- so this path hands back what
    the fingerprint proves is theirs, exactly as the other one does.

    Never widens what a restore will accept. The fingerprint is re-taken over the
    bytes that actually arrived on THIS read rather than carried over from the
    first, so the pin is on the object in hand and not on a claim about it.

    Exactly one extra read, and only on a path that was already going to refuse.
    There is no loop and no walk of the version list: the recorded id names one
    version, and if that one is not there this install has nothing to recover.
    Costing a second request on the way to the same refusal is the worst case.

    The id comes from local state, which is where a version id can be trusted from
    -- it is written by this install's own successful push, and
    ``apps/aws-control/data`` is neither agent-readable nor agent-writable (it sits
    behind the agent file-tool floor and is bind-masked from every agent sandbox). It
    is still validated on the way OUT, because a stored value read back later can be
    truncated or partially rewritten, and it travels as a separate argv element where
    a leading ``-`` would change what the command means. There is no shell in the
    path.

    record therefore reports one archive for a prefix holding several, and an
    operator cannot see that anything is accumulating there. This count says the
    single run line is not the list.

    A COUNT OF RECORDS, never an inventory, and it misses in BOTH directions.
    It reads LOW when :data:`MAX_REMEMBERED_UPLOADS` drops the oldest record once
    the map is full, and when another install wrote to the same drive, since only
    this install's own pushes are recorded. It reads HIGH after retention: the
    sweep deletes the object and :func:`_prune_recorded_versions` clears only the
    ``upload_versions`` entry, so the ``uploads`` key this counts outlives the
    archive it names -- with ``keep=3`` after ten nightlies this answers 10 while
    the list the row's own button opens shows 3. Only a listing can say what the
    drive really holds, and that call is the OPT-IN half of the backup status read
    for what it costs. The row is therefore worded as a record count and hands the
    reader to that listing rather than standing in for it.

    Counted from :func:`uploaded_objects`, so it carries this process's
    unpersisted pushes for the reason that function does: the archive is in the
    bucket whether or not the state write landed.

    A key is attributed by its FIRST segment, which is the kind's subpath -- the
    segment, not a string prefix, so one subpath that starts with another's text
    cannot absorb its keys. A legacy key from before the install-id namespace
    still carries that segment, so its archive counts for the kind that wrote it
    rather than being dropped. A key under no known subpath is counted for no

    This is the record whose absence is the reported defect: without it the state
    file holds nothing at all about a nightly that has been failing since a
    particular day, so :func:`due_for_nightly` cannot tell a fault it has already
    met from one it is seeing for the first time, and the loop re-attempts on every
    wake forever.

    ``run_witness`` is :func:`nightly_run_witness` read BEFORE the attempt began, and it
    is REQUIRED rather than defaulted. A default would let a call site added later opt
    out of the race protocol silently, which is the shape of the bug it exists to close:
    the two writers serialize under the sidecar lock, but each mutate re-reads fresh
    state, so an unconditional write here can land AFTER a concurrent manual success
    cleared the count and record a failure against a kind that just succeeded.

    What that costs was MEASURED rather than assumed, because the obvious claim is wrong:
    the raced write restarts the count at 1, :func:`nightly_retry_delay_secs` answers 0
    there, and the fresh run record already holds the account not-due for the window --
    so it withholds no attempt. What it does produce is a false :func:`nightly_failures`
    row for an account that just backed up, plus a one-step skew on the next genuine
    failure. The row is the reason this guard ships: making that state readable is half
    of what this change is for, so writing a knowingly false one would undo it at the
    surface it just built.

    Returns ``None`` when the slot moved during the attempt, having written nothing. That
    direction is deliberate: skipping a real failure costs the extra attempts the loop
    already makes today, while writing a false one publishes a failure row against an
    account that just backed up and skews the next genuine failure's count by one, so
    every ambiguity here resolves toward attempting the backup -- the same posture
    :func:`_backoff_withholds` and :func:`_a_day_since_last_run` take.

    SCHEDULED callers only, and that is the same line
    :func:`_unattended_sessions_redaction_gap` already draws one screen up: an owner
    pressing the button is present, sees the failure, and chooses whether to try
    again, so recording their attempt here would let a person retrying by hand push
    out the unattended schedule they are retrying on behalf of. What the owner path
    does reach is the CLEAR, inside :func:`_record_run_locked` -- a success counts
    from anywhere, a failure only counts where nobody was watching.

    Never raises, by the rule :func:`_record_run` follows on the same state file:
    this runs on a path that is already handling a failed backup, so letting an
    unwritable state file raise here would replace a logged failure with an
    unhandled one and cost the caller its audit record. A count that did not
    persist leaves the loop retrying as it does today, which is the direction this
    whole change is careful to fail in.

    is not an oversight: the destination is owner-only and re-verified at every
    upload, so the documented trade is that hardening protects the payload and

    The asymmetry this closes is narrow and only exists for an operator who DID

    archive cannot use that seam, because it refuses an archive with more than one

    hold a pasted secret in the first place.
