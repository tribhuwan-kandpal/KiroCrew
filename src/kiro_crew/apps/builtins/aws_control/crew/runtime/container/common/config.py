"""Environment contract for the three container processes.

Every process in the task reads its configuration from here and nowhere else.
Parsing happens once, at import of `load()`, and the result is frozen: a process
that disagrees with another about a path or a port is the failure mode this
module exists to prevent.

`SMC_` is a historical prefix. It stands for an earlier project name and says
nothing about what this deployment is: a task belongs to the owner who launched
it, one principal reaches it, and there is no sharing surface, no second caller
and no guest. `SMC_SINGLE_PRINCIPAL` below is what the container refuses to boot
without, and it is the opposite of a sharing switch -- it is the deployment
vouching that only one principal can reach the task. Renaming the prefix would
touch the image, the task definition and every test that constructs an
environment, so the names stay and this paragraph is the correction.

Two values are deliberately NOT configurable.

`BACKEND_HOST` is fixed at 127.0.0.1. The Kiro Crew backend must never be
reachable from the network, and a setting is a thing an operator can get wrong.

The backend's authentication secret is not here either. It is generated per boot
and is read from disk on every use; see `secret.py`.

#: Ceiling on an object this task will read from the bucket into memory, or warn about
#: sending to it.
#:
#: Pinned here because every process that moves an object reads it, and a second copy is
#: the drift the shared key module exists to prevent in the other direction. The front
#: holds a fetched transcript IN MEMORY for the length of a turn and the restore step holds
#: an authority file long enough to validate and write it, so without a ceiling one object
#: decides how much memory the task uses. The sidecar reads the same number to say so at
#: upload time, when an operator can still act, rather than leaving a customer's turn to
#: discover it.
#:
#: 64 MiB is far above any real transcript or slot index (both are JSON text) and far below
#: the task's memory, so it separates "a big conversation" from "an object that should not
#: be read at all" without needing to know which conversations exist.
MAX_OBJECT_BYTES: int = 64 * 1024 * 1024

#: How long one bucket request may take, and how many attempts it gets.
#:
#: Declared here because the supervisor's sidecar drain window is sized against them:
#: the final cycle has to finish inside that window, so one hung connection must not be
#: able to consume it. boto3's own defaults are minutes long with more retries, which is
#: the right posture for a long-running client and the wrong one for a process that is
#: being drained.
BACKUP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS: int = 5
BACKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS: int = 3

#: How long each child gets to drain at teardown, and the stop timeout their sum requires.
#:
#: Declared here rather than in the supervisor because the sum is ONE CONTRACT SPLIT ACROSS
#: TWO SUBSYSTEMS. The supervisor spends these windows in order; the task definition the
#: control plane registers must give the task at least their sum, or the platform SIGKILLs
#: the supervisor mid-drain. Both read this module, so neither can move without the other.
#:
#: The front goes first, to stop new turns arriving. The backend gets the longest of the
#: three because a ``kiro-cli`` worker setsid's into its own process group, so only the
#: backend's own SIGTERM handler can reap it and a shorter window orphans workers that go
#: on to finish their turn. The sidecar goes last, and its window is for ONE cycle that
#: begins AFTER it is signalled -- the objects the backend's drain just produced, not a
#: full pass, since everything earlier is already recorded uploaded. That window is sized
#: against the transport rather than guessed: ``BACKUP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`` times
#: ``BACKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` bounds one PUT, and this holds several, so a cycle waiting on a
#: slow bucket finishes instead of being killed.
#:
#: A cut final cycle still costs at most the turns since the last interval, and the objects
#: it did upload stay durable, so the worst case is bounded and loud rather than total --
#: but it is a worst case, not the planned window. Fargate caps ``stopTimeout`` at 120s,
#: which the sum has to stay under.

#: What one object can cost the final cycle: one PUT's whole retry budget.
#:
#: The final cycle uploads sequentially, so its total is this times the number of changed
#: objects, which nothing bounds. The cycle therefore carries a DEADLINE and stops
#: attempting objects it cannot finish inside the drain window, naming each one it did not
#: reach. That converts an overrun from a SIGKILL in the middle of a PUT -- which loses the
#: object being sent and says nothing about the rest -- into a short cycle that reports
#: exactly what is missing and exits non-zero.
BACKUP_PER_OBJECT_BUDGET_SECS: float = BACKUP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS * BACKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS
#: Slack between the last drain window and the platform's own stop timeout.
#:
#: Draining is not only the children's own time: each group is signalled, waited on, then
#: swept and reaped, and the orphan sweep runs afterwards. Without this margin the task
#: timeout equals the windows exactly, so the reap overhead alone puts the supervisor past
#: it and the platform kills the process that was about to report cleanly.
