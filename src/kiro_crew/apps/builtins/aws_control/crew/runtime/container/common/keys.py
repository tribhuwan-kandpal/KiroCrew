"""One derivation of every object key this task reads or writes.

Two processes address the same bucket for opposite reasons. The sidecar PUTs a
conversation's transcript and the two authority files; the front GETs one
transcript on the turn that continues it. They must agree on the key exactly, and
drift between them is invisible in both directions: a GET simply misses, and a
customer whose history was not found is indistinguishable from a new customer.

So the derivation lives here and neither process keeps its own copy. The first
live deployment doubled the crew name in every key (``crews/<crew>/<crew>/``)
because two places each decided one prefix, and twelve green gates passed it
because writer and reader agreed with each other while both disagreed with the
contract. A shared definition is what makes that class of mistake unrepresentable
rather than tested for.

## The layout

``<backup_prefix>/<crew_name>/data/<tail>``, where ``tail`` is the object's path
inside the data home. Transcripts are ``data/sessions/<stem>.jsonl``, archived
segments keep their own path under ``data/sessions/archive/``, and the authority
files sit at the data home's root, so theirs are ``data/session_map.json`` and
``data/open_slots.json``.

The ``data/`` namespace is a segment of its own so that anything the owner's
control plane later files beside the data (a manifest, a label) cannot collide with
a conversation whose slot id happens to match.

## One function does the work

Every key comes from :func:`data_key`, which is the only place a path becomes a
key. :func:`transcript_key` and :func:`authority_key` are the two named cases and
both call it, so a transcript addressed by its slot stem and the same file
addressed by its path cannot produce two different keys. Writing either case out
separately is how the two ways of naming one object start to disagree.
