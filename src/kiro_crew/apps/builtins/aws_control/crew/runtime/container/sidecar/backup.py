"""One backup cycle: what must be durable, and how each object is copied.

## What is in the set

Three kinds, and the set is a definition rather than a filter, so "was this file
backed up" has an answer that does not depend on what the directory happened to
hold:

1. **The two authority files**, ``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json``. They
   turn a slot id back into a conversation, so without them the transcripts are on
   disk and the conversation list is empty.
2. **Every live transcript**, the ``.jsonl`` files directly under the sessions
   directory. One per conversation this task has served.
3. **Every archived segment** under ``sessions/archive/``. Rotation moves the older
   part of a long conversation there and the container never reads it back -- the
   front's fetch may not list, and finding a segment requires listing -- so these are
   uploaded for the owner's control plane, which has credentials of its own. Leaving
   them behind would be silent loss of the older half of every long conversation.

Anything else under the sessions directory is not in the set. The front writes a
temporary file there while fetching and unlinks it itself, and a name that is
neither that nor a transcript is not a conversation.

## What order they go in, and why the order is a correctness rule

The transcripts go first and the authority files last, in their own phase. The
authority files are the INDEX: a replacement reads them to decide which conversations
exist, and the front then fetches each named transcript lazily. So an authority table
newer than the transcripts it names points at objects that are not in the bucket, and
the front reads an absent transcript as a conversation with no history -- a live
conversation served empty, with nothing raised anywhere. The opposite skew is
harmless: an authority table older than the transcripts names only slots whose bytes
are already there, and a transcript it does not name yet is unreferenced rather than
misread.

Which is why the authority files are OPENED first, before a single transcript is
listed, and sent from those descriptors at the end. Opening fixes the instant a file
describes, so the pair is one coherent snapshot of the index taken before the
enumeration it indexes. Reading them at send time instead let a slot table flushed
during the cycle name a transcript that cycle never listed.

That rests on the backend publishing both files the way it publishes a transcript, a
temporary file and a rename, which leaves an open descriptor addressing the whole
previous version. It does: ``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json`` are both written
through an atomic replace. A writer that truncated one in place instead would take the
snapshot property away without changing anything here, so it is pinned by a test rather
than left as an assumption.

For the same reason the authority phase is SKIPPED entirely when the transcript phase
refused anything. Publishing it then would advance the index past bytes this cycle
failed to write; withholding it leaves the pair at the last cycle that completed,
which is older and coherent.

One residual remains in the pair itself. The two files are two PUTs, so a failure
between them leaves the bucket holding one from this cycle's snapshot and one from an
earlier cycle's. Both were opened before this cycle's enumeration, so neither names a
transcript that is absent, and the failure raises rather than passing quietly; the cost
is one interval in which the two files disagree about which slots exist, which the next
cycle resolves.

## How one object is copied

``open_snapshot`` opens the file ONCE and records the length that descriptor's file
had at that moment. The upload then sends exactly that many bytes from that
descriptor. Three properties follow, and they are the three constraints this design
has to hold at the same time:

* **Consistent** without a lock. The backend publishes a transcript with a temporary
  file and a rename, so it never writes into the bytes behind an open descriptor --
  it swaps the directory entry to a different inode. A descriptor opened before the
  swap keeps addressing a whole, finished version, and a file that is appended to
  instead is uploaded as the prefix that existed at open time, which is also a
  version that was really on disk.
* **Bounded** on disk. Nothing is copied first. A cycle spends one descriptor and one
  fixed transport buffer per object, so an oversized artifact cannot fill the
  filesystem the app is writing to.
* **Nothing dropped.** There is no size at which an object is skipped. An entry that
  genuinely cannot be uploaded is recorded and the cycle ends by RAISING
  :class:`BackupIncomplete` -- after uploading everything it could, so one bad entry
  does not cost every other conversation its backup.

## Every shape an entry can have, and what happens to it

## What the fingerprint is for, and what it is not

Change detection is a COST decision, not a correctness one. The fingerprint is the
inode, the length and the modification time as they were at open, and an object is
re-uploaded whenever it differs from the one last uploaded successfully. It lives in
memory, so a restarted sidecar re-uploads everything once: paying for a full cycle is
the right way to be wrong here, and persisting the state would put a second authority
on disk to keep in agreement with the bucket.
