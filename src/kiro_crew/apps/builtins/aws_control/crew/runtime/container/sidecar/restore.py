"""Bringing the two authority files back, before the backend can overwrite them.

## Why this runs before the backend and not beside it

``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json`` are what turn a slot id back into a
conversation. The backend flushes them periodically from its own in-memory state, so
a backend that starts before they are on disk starts with an empty slot table and
then PERSISTS that emptiness over the restored files. The conversation list comes up
blank, the transcripts are still on disk, and nothing reports a fault.

So the restore is not "early for speed". Finishing before the backend starts is the
correctness rule, and this function is called from the supervisor's startup order
where that is enforced, not from the sidecar, which does not exist yet at that point.

Transcripts are deliberately NOT restored here. The front fetches the one transcript
a turn continues, on that turn, which keeps the property that a task only ever holds
the conversations it has itself served. Downloading them all at boot would undo that
and would need a bucket listing, which the front's reader cannot do.

## Why the bytes are validated before they are written

Both of the backend's own readers ignore an authority file they cannot parse and
carry on with an empty result. That is right for them and wrong for this step: a
malformed object written here would be read as "no conversations" and then replaced by
the flush, so the restore would look like it worked and the customer's list would be
empty. Refusing to boot instead turns a silent loss into a message an operator gets
before the task serves a turn.

The check is exactly as strict as those readers require -- the file must be a JSON
object, and ``open_slots.json``'s ``keys`` must be a list if it is present -- and no
stricter. A schema invented here would refuse a file the backend would have accepted.

## What an existing local file means

It is kept. Nothing has started, so a file already at the path did not come from this
boot's backend: it came from a data home that outlived the task, and that copy leads
the bucket by up to one backup interval. Overwriting it would roll a conversation list
backwards. ``link_new`` makes that a filesystem guarantee rather than a check.
