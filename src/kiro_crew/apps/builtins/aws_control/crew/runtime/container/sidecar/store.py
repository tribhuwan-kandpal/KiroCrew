"""The bucket, as the two narrowest operations the durability pair needs.

``put`` and ``get``, and nothing else. There is no ``list`` and no ``delete``, for
the same reason the front's reader has neither: a capability that exists is a
capability a later edit can reach for, and both of those change what the pair
means. A ``list`` on the restore side turns "bring back this task's own authority
files" into "enumerate the bucket", and a ``delete`` puts retention -- deciding
that a customer's history may go -- inside the process whose job is to keep it.

## Why ``put`` takes a descriptor and a size

Both halves of the consistency property live in that signature. The caller opens
the file ONCE and hands over the open descriptor, so the bytes uploaded are the
bytes that descriptor addresses, whatever later happens to the name. And the size
is the caller's, measured on the same descriptor at the same moment, so the upload
sends exactly the length that was true then.

Together they make a coherent copy without a lock and without a staged duplicate:

* The backend publishes a transcript with a temporary file and a rename, so it
  never writes into the bytes behind an open descriptor -- it swaps the directory
  entry to a different inode. A descriptor opened before the swap therefore keeps
  addressing a whole, finished version.
* A file that is instead appended to grows behind the descriptor. Sending exactly
  the recorded length uploads the prefix that existed at open time, which is a
  version that was really on disk. The next cycle sees a newer size and sends the
  longer one.

Neither case copies the file first, so there is nothing to bound: the upload spends
one descriptor and one fixed buffer, not a second copy of the data.

## What is NOT here

Absence, permanence and the read ceiling. Those are in ``common/objects.py``, shared
with the front's reader, because the first version kept a copy in each process and the
copies disagreed about a missing bucket within one revision. This module is the two
requests and nothing else.
