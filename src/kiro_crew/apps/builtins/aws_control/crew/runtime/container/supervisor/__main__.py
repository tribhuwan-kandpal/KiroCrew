"""Container entrypoint: order the task, supervise it, drain it on shutdown.

Run as ``python -m container.supervisor``. This is the task's init process. It
does not serve anything itself; it enforces the startup order the contract makes
a correctness requirement and then supervises the children.

The order (``docs/system-specs/modules/aws-control.md``, "Four processes, one task"):

1. Gate the environment (layout, model credential, sandbox) and install the crew
   bundle. Nothing has started.
2. The authority files are restored to completion. This is before the backend on
   purpose: the backend flushes the slot table from its own memory, so a backend
   that starts first persists an empty one over the restored files.
3. The backend starts and ``wait_until_ready`` returns (port answers AND the
   boot secret exists).
4. The front process starts, and then the sidecar, whose first cycle copies what
   the backend has written.

A task with no bucket configured has no durability: steps 2 and the sidecar are
both no-ops, the front says so once at startup, and the task serves turns.

Shutdown drains process groups, not pids (see ``process.py``): a ``kiro-cli``
worker is a two-process tree and signalling only the launcher orphans a child
that finishes its turn. Teardown order is front, then backend: stop new turns
arriving first, then let the backend drain in-flight work and flush to disk.
Anything still alive after the backend is gone is an escaped worker it could not
reap, so the teardown sweeps orphaned process groups directly.

Track boundaries: the front ``__main__`` seam is imported by its documented path,
lazily, so this module stays importable and testable and never reimplements the
other track's work.
