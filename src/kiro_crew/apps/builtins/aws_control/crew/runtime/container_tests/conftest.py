"""Reach the container package the way the image does: by its build context.

The subject of this suite is imported as top-level ``container.*``, because that
is what it is inside the image -- ``/app`` is on ``sys.path`` and the package
sits at ``/app/container``. Modules import ``container.common`` absolutely, so
that name is part of the image's contract rather than an artifact of where the
source sits in the image. Rewriting the imports to this repository's package
path would break the image at runtime.

``crew/runtime/`` therefore has no ``__init__.py``: it is a docker build
context, not a python package, and
``test_spawn_audit.py::test_container_image_assets_are_not_imported`` pins that
so the gateway can never import this tree by package path. Putting the build
context on ``sys.path`` here is what lets the tests resolve ``container`` while
that stays true.

pytest's prepend import mode happens to insert this same directory (it is the
first ancestor without an ``__init__.py``), so this file is belt and braces --
but the import root is a fact about the image, not about a pytest setting, and
it should be stated somewhere that survives a change to either.

# It exists because a skip is indistinguishable from a pass in every report anyone
# reads, and the skips below are wide: a missing image dependency takes the WHOLE
# suite out of collection, so 236 tests can be entirely absent from a run that
# reports success. Installing those dependencies in a dedicated job is not enough on
# its own, because it fixes the environment and not the mechanism: a dependency
# rename, an extras split or a resolver change puts that lane back to reporting
# success while collecting nothing, with no signal anywhere.
#
# So the lane that installs them also declares that it MUST be able to run them, and
# under that declaration every reason this file would decline to collect becomes a
# hard error instead. The rule is one-directional on purpose: this variable can only

# Not collected on a non-POSIX host. This suite's SUBJECT is the source of a Linux
# container image, built by the deploy driver and run on Fargate -- not part of the
# application that installs on a user's machine. It depends on POSIX primitives that
# are not incidental: the supervisor forks and signals a process group, and the
# layout tests assert container filesystem paths. Running it on Windows measures
# nothing about the only platform the image runs on, and it failed there for exactly
# that reason.
#
# Marking individual tests was tried first and is the wrong shape: the POSIX
# dependencies are spread across the suite, so the list was already incomplete and
# the next test to touch a fork/signal path would redden Windows again without
# changing anything real. Skipping the whole tree on a non-POSIX host is the honest
# unit.
#
# The suite is ALSO not collected when the image's own runtime dependencies are not
# importable. ``container/requirements.txt`` (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, boto3) is
# marked "Container runtime only. These must NOT become dependencies of the Kiro
# Crew app itself" -- the app's backend hooks are imported into every owner's
# gateway process, and a web framework there buys nothing. So the application's own
# CI environment installs ``-e .[voice,desktop] --group dev`` and does NOT carry
# these, yet ``testpaths`` in ``setup.cfg`` walks ``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins``
# and reaches this tree: four modules ``import httpx`` (the front's backend client)
# at module top level, which is a collection-time ``ModuleNotFoundError`` that
# cascades every backend shard. The image build context and any developer machine
# that installs ``requirements-dev.txt`` DO carry them, so the suite still runs
# where their subject can -- this only declines to run them where the deliberately
# absent deps make the subject unimportable, rather than forcing the app env to
# grow a dependency the runtime contract forbids.
#
# Only the deps imported AT MODULE TOP LEVEL by the test modules gate collection:
# ``httpx`` (four modules), ``fastapi`` and ``uvicorn`` (``test_front_proxy``).
# ``boto3`` is deliberately NOT in this list -- ``front/transcript.py`` imports it
# lazily inside a function ("keep the package importable without AWS"), so it is
# never touched at collection time and a venv without it (the app's own dev env is
# one) collects and runs this suite fine. Listing it here would skip the suite on
