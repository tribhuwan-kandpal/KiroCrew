"""The four ways the first version of this pair claimed durability it did not have.

Each test here exists because a review found a path where the writer reported success,
or kept reporting progress, while a task replacement would still have lost the
conversation. They are grouped in one file because they are one theme: the difference
between "the backup ran" and "the bytes are in the bucket".

1. **The shutdown cycle has to BEGIN after the stop.** The supervisor signals this
   process only after the backend has flushed, so a cycle already running when the
   signal lands cannot contain that flush. Accepting it as the final one loses exactly
   the turns the final cycle exists to save.
2. **A failure no retry resolves has to end the process.** A denied ``PutObject`` is
   not a slow bucket. Retrying it at the next interval forever fills the log while the
   task keeps taking turns nothing will ever save.
3. **A missing bucket is not an absent object.** Read as absence, it reports both
   authority files missing, and the backend boots with an empty slot table and flushes
   it over the real one.
4. **A symlink above a file is as dangerous as a symlink at it.** ``O_NOFOLLOW`` guards
   the last name only, so a plain descent follows a link planted at the archive
   directory -- which the agent writes in -- and uploads every file behind it.
5. **The index must not name bytes that are not there.** The authority files say which
   conversations exist and the front fetches each named transcript lazily, so an
   authority table uploaded ahead of its transcripts sends the front to an absent
   object, which it reads as a conversation that never had history.
6. **The index is a snapshot, not a read.** Opening the authority files fixes the
   instant they describe. Read at send time instead, a slot the backend flushed
   mid-cycle names a transcript that cycle never enumerated.
7. **A retry that cannot rewind the body is not a retry.** The store budgets three
   attempts, so the transport seeks the body back before sending again; a body that
   refuses turns every transient error into a lost object.
8. **The final cycle needs a bound, not just a window.** It uploads sequentially and
   nothing bounds how many objects changed, so the drain window can elapse mid-upload.
   A deadline turns that from a kill into a short cycle that names what it missed.
9. **The index needs its own room inside that bound.** A data phase allowed to spend
   the whole deadline leaves the authority pair none, and those PUTs are then killed
   mid-request -- publishing one file and not the other.
10. **Publication links an inode, not a name.** Closing the temporary before linking it
    publishes whatever its pathname points at by then, and these are directories the
    agent writes in.
