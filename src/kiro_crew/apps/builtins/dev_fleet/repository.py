    while nothing is resolved, so a user who answers the setup card stops seeing that
    card without restarting the gateway. Single-flight, so several concurrent first
    requests run discovery once between them rather than racing the globals below.

    Latched only once a checkout RESOLVED. An unresolved process has no answer worth
    keeping — there is no fleet to serve, and the answer changes the moment the

    too, and renders its own banner naming the path and the remedy rather than asking
    for a restart. That latch is reopened by ``_invalid_resolution_is_stale`` once the

    verdict survives beside it, because then ``_repo()`` hands out a path whose
    markers were never checked — and ``worktree remove``, ``update-ref -d``,
    ``pull --ff-only`` and ``pip install -e`` run inside whatever that is.

    Discovery runs on a local so the global is written exactly once per attempt —

    them in listing order lets an archive or fork remote outvote ``origin``.
    ``_upstream_remote`` resolves independently and falls back to ``origin``, so

    The local candidates are the fallback, and they need no remote at all — which
    matters, because remote resolution reads ``branch.<base>.remote`` and

    local branch composes with that read: ``_upstream_remote`` resolves the remote

      when git could not answer — which callers must treat as unverifiable,

      never counts as dirt. An empty list means "none found OR git failed" — it
      is deliberately not a promise, and the discard path treats an empty list
      as "nothing approved to discard".

    Why two commands instead of parsing one ``--porcelain`` blob: ``-uno``
    suppresses untracked entries, so anything it prints is a tracked change and
    a plain non-empty test suffices; ``ls-files --others`` prints bare paths
    with no status columns to misparse.

    The untracked half deliberately bypasses the shared ``_git`` helper, which
    strips its output and would corrupt a first or last filename carrying
    leading or trailing whitespace. These paths are not merely displayed — they
    become the ``git clean`` pathspec deciding which files a discard destroys —
    so they must survive byte-exact. A corrupted path would simply fail to
    match and abort the removal, which is safe but is a refusal nobody earned.
