    entry is deliberately omitted from every emitted spec — and retracted from
    an existing one on refresh — so on such a host the entry's absence is the
    HEALTHY state, not a broken install. Doctor's static checks must consult
    the same predicate or the two sides drift apart, producing the unfixable
    "missing from mcpServers (re-run `kirocrew setup`)" loop on every host
    where the gate is closed. Resolving the gate through the registry
    keeps them pinned together: a future server gaining a gate needs no edit
    here, and a server without one reports open, exactly as emission treats it.

    The ``except`` covers gate-CONTRACT failures only — a registry entry that
    is not a dict, or a gate callable that raises past its own handling. For
    those, the fail direction is deliberately the OPPOSITE of emission's
    ``agent._gated_off_servers()``: there, a gate that raises is treated as
    closed, because the open position hands out a backend the operator may not
    want running; here it reports NOT closed, because "closed" is what
    silences the missing-entry error. Each side fails toward its own safe
    state. Note the scope honestly: the shipped computer-use gate catches its
    own internal errors and ANSWERS ``False`` (its documented fail-closed
    posture — an unreadable keystone must never hand out the desktop), so an
    unreadable keystone is indistinguishable from policy-closed through the
    boolean, by the gate's own design. That answer is still the
    emission-CONSISTENT one to report: in that state the entry genuinely is
    omitted from every emitted spec, so the ℹ️ line describes what the system
    actually does, even when the underlying cause is a broken enable-state
    read rather than a decision.

    Never loads a native driver: the computer-use gate reads only the enable
    keystone and platform flags (see ``agent._computer_use_spec_gate``), which

    harnesses (``providers/mirrors/README.md``): a session comes up with
    ``tools: ["@kirocrew-core", ...]`` and nothing defining ``kirocrew-core``, so
    every Crew tool is absent while the harness works and nothing anywhere is red.
    A row here is the answer to "my agent has no tools on this backend" that
    otherwise takes a diagnosis.

    Reports only, and appends NO entry to ``issues``, on the terms
    :func:`_doctor_strict_identity` sets: a harness the operator has not adopted
    having no projection yet is a known state of the tree, not a broken install,
    and failing doctor's exit code on it would make every stock host red for a
    backend nobody selected.

    Asks ``agent_sdk`` rather than assembling the answer here. The refs need the
    agent spec and each backend's spec projection, both of which live below the
    boundary, so reaching them from this module would take three new ACP /
    providers edges the agent-sdk-boundary gate refuses -- and correctly: which
    file a harness reads its servers from is exactly the knowledge a consumer is
    not supposed to hold. ``agent_spec_mcp_refs`` reads the mirror seam, so a
    backend projecting outside ``providers/mirrors/`` (KAS) reads as unprojected;
    ``has_mirror`` is what lets the row say which case it is.

    kiro-cli resolves its refs against the spec it is handed, so a healthy install
    prints a clean row there rather than every ref it declares -- the resolver keys
    that on the backend id, not on this function.

    :func:`_doctor_unresolved_mcp_refs` answers this per selectable harness, off

    harness the operator actually configured, and it answers it for a spec that
    references no server at all: a ``no-channel`` backend has no transport that
    can carry Crew's servers, so every Crew tool is absent from its sessions
    whatever the spec says. That is a property of the harness, not of the spec,
    and a spec with an empty ``tools`` list produces no unresolved ref to hang it
    off.

    The no-channel row prints only for that one kind. ``native``, ``mirror`` and

    """The MCP ability of the harness IN USE, and which others cost a whole server.

    The rows above answer for the selected harness only when something about it is
    wrong. This answers what a reader asks before switching, and what the selected
    harness is doing to their agent file right now: these harnesses are not
    interchangeable, and every way they differ over the spec has until now lived in
    source, in a spec document, or in a log line nobody reads.

    **Two lines on a stock run, not a table.** The full per-harness comparison is the
    dashboard's job -- it has the room, the labels in thirteen languages, and a reader
    who came to compare. A terminal report is read by someone diagnosing one install,
    and a row apiece for six harnesses on every run is a section people learn to skip,
    which costs the report more than the comparison was worth. So exactly two facts
    print here:

    * the ability card of the harness IN USE -- its projection kind, the reach of a
      per-tool MCP restriction, and the spec keys it withholds or has no channel for.
      This one is not a comparison: it is what the reader's own sessions are doing;
    * the harnesses where switching one tool off can withhold CREW'S OWN servers, named
      on one line, because that is the fact a chooser needs before they switch and the
      one an operator otherwise meets by accident. Narrower than "costs a whole server"
      on purpose: a ``per-call`` harness withholds a third-party server whole and still
      refuses per tool on Crew's own, so its session keeps the channel it came from and
      the panel is where that difference has room to be explained.

    Everything else about the harnesses not in use -- their withholds, their gaps,
    their kinds -- is in the panel, which is where a reader comparing harnesses is: this
    report answers for the install in front of it and names the one cross-harness cost
    that a chooser cannot act without.

    **Values, not prose, and the ROUTE lives here.** The row prints what the
    declaration says -- the kind and the reach in the registry's own spelling -- rather
    than an English gloss of it. The panel owns the prose, and it deliberately owns
    LESS: ``native``/``mirror``/``external`` costs a reader choosing a harness nothing,
    so the card does not carry it and this report is where it is stated. The register
    suits that reader anyway: they are in a terminal and the next thing they do is read
    ``providers/mirrors/registry.py``.

    **One consequence sentence, for one reach.** The exception, and it is not a gloss
    of the row: ``whole-server`` means switching a single tool off withholds the whole
    server that tool belongs to, and where that server is ``kirocrew-core`` that
    session cannot report back to the channel it came from. Conditional because the
    condition is real -- a narrowed third-party server costs that server and not the
    channel -- and a reader who only ever sees the declared value recovers neither.
    Which reaches carry the cost at all is the projection's judgement
    (``McpAbility.costs_control_plane``), not this report's.

    Nothing is authored per harness, so a newly onboarded backend is covered the moment
    its ``PROJECTIONS`` entry exists.

    Reports only, and appends NO entry to ``issues``, on the terms every row in this
    neighbourhood sets: a declared difference between harnesses is what the
    declaration is FOR, and failing doctor's exit code on one would make choosing a
    harness read as a fault. It declares; it changes nothing and gates nothing.

    Asks ``agent_sdk`` rather than reading ``providers/mirrors`` here: the declaration
    lives below the boundary and reaching it from a consumer would take an edge the
    agent-sdk-boundary gate refuses. Both surfaces of this card, and what each owes a
    reader, are written down once in ``providers/mirrors/README.md`` ("Fill the card").

    row whatsoever, and a KAS block asserting in prose whose token it used. Each
    was a separate edit, so a harness that became selectable without one was
    simply silent here -- which is how a signed-out harness could read as ready.
    Now the row comes from ``agent_sdk.host_auth``, the same declaration the
    credential floor and ``GET /api/acp-backends`` read, so doctor cannot say
    something the panel contradicts.

    Iterates ``acp_backends.selectable_backend_values()`` -- the sorted form of
    ``selectable_backends()``, which is already this module's neighbourhood via
    ``_doctor_claude_backend``'s local ``acp_backends`` import. Chosen over
    ``agent_sdk.probe_backends()`` for two reasons: it is the set the operator can
    actually select (a policy-denied harness needs no sign-in advice), and it
    answers without spawning the install probes' subprocesses, which this row does
    not need.

    **This checks only credentials that are the host's own, and deliberately.**
    Two stores qualify: the HOST identity store, probed through ``kiro-cli
    whoami`` (kiro-cli signs in to it, so its state is the host's own and
    readable here), and Crew's own sign-in vault, which a harness in
    ``ACP_BACKENDS_HOST_AUTH_CALLBACK`` draws on whenever the vault holds a
    usable identity -- the same runtime decision the KAS relay makes at spawn,
    so the row reports the store the next spawn will actually use. Every other
    harness keeps its entitlement in a file it owns, and reading that file is
    exactly what the credential floor exists to forbid -- a probe here would be
    the one reader the floor cannot fence. So those rows name the store and
    print the declared remedy unprobed: advice that is always correct beats a
    verdict obtained by breaking the floor.

    Advisory only, which is why it takes no ``issues`` list: a harness the operator
    has not signed into is not a broken installation, and failing doctor's exit code

# `last_status === 'error'`, with `last_error` on hover), and the gateway
# re-alerts on a still-failing job hourly. Both of those run INSIDE the
# gateway, so neither can speak when the gateway is the thing that is wedged.
# Doctor is a separate process the user runs by hand, which is why the scan
# reads `crons.json` off disk rather than asking the gateway's HTTP API: a check
# whose purpose is to survive a down gateway must not depend on one.
#
# It also covers a gap the dashboard has by construction: the status badge is
# rendered under an `enabled` guard, so a job that auto-paused shows only
# "paused" and its error state is not displayed at all.
#
# The scan itself lives in `cron.unhealthy_jobs_from_disk` so the pause-state
# predicates keep the single owner `cron.py` declares for them; this module owns
# only the presentation.
#
# Read-only, like the rest of doctor: an auto-paused job has failed
# `_AUTO_PAUSE_THRESHOLD` times in a row and is usually paused for a good
# reason, so silently resuming it during a diagnostic would hide the very
# problem the user ran doctor to find. The remediation is a `Fix:` hint naming
