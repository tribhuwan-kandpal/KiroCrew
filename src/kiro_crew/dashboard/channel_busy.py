"""Hand a channel message to the dashboard turn that is driving its resumed session.

A Discord, Telegram or Teams conversation can be bound to a dashboard session
(``dashboard:<slot>``) through the channel's session-switch command. Its turns
then run under that key, and so do the dashboard's own: the composer, a
``session_send`` from a peer session, a cron injection. When a channel message
arrives while such a turn is in flight, WHO holds the turn decides where the
message can wait.

* The channel itself (or a sibling turn the channel started) holds it: the
  channel's own mid-turn machinery applies -- ``_session/steer`` into the live
  provider, or the channel's ``SessionManager`` queue, drained from the tail of
  the channel turn that is running. Nothing here is involved.
* The DASHBOARD holds it: the channel's queue is the wrong place to wait. That
  queue is drained only from the tail of a channel-driven turn, and the dashboard
  turn loop knows nothing of it, so an entry left there would sit until some later
  channel turn on the same session and then run out of order -- or never, if the
  user keeps working from the dashboard. The dashboard slot already has a queue the
  running turn's teardown drains (``chat_delivery.queue_for_next_turn`` /
  ``_start_next_queued_turn``), so the message is handed to THAT queue and runs as
  the next dashboard turn in arrival order behind whatever the composer queued.
  Its reply reaches the channel through the session's outbound mirror, the same
  leg every dashboard turn on a linked session already takes.

The queue arm only, deliberately. The dashboard's steer path
(``steer_into_running_turn``) keeps its requeue bookkeeping in per-message maps
that record the composer's provenance and not a channel's, so a steer that the
turn never consumed would be requeued as dashboard-authored text and run with
the wider dashboard authority (``_directive_channel_origin`` is the narrower
credential boundary). Queueing carries the channel provenance and the
admission-time containment on the entry itself, which is what the drain's
re-validation reads.

Attachments cannot ride this hand-off: a channel attachment is a transport
descriptor the CHANNEL turn downloads and ingests, and the dashboard queue has no
reader for it. Such a message is refused with a resend prompt rather than queued
without its files, which is the one outcome worse than refusing.

The precedent is Slack's linked-thread intercept (``slack/handler.py``), which
hands a linked thread's message to the slot queue with ``directive_user_origin``
and ``directive_channel_origin`` both set and lets the dashboard drain run it. It
consumes the same producer with the same origin stamp, so this module's drain
contract -- drop once the binding is gone, tell the conversation -- covers the
Slack thread too. This module is that contract for every channel that resumes a
dashboard session.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> dashboard``: the messaging package imports
nothing from the dashboard, so the channel dispatchers reach this module at call
time, the way they already reach ``channel_slots.project_channel_turn_live``.
