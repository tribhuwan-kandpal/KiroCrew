        replaces was self-evident in the 400, whereas a successful consented
        download would otherwise leave no trace.

        *granted* arrives already resolved because reading it ends in a

        the in-memory half of the test.

        TWO conjuncts, and the second is not redundant. This route is absent from
        every ``token_auth`` bypass list, which establishes that it needs
        AUTHENTICATION -- not that it needs OWNER IDENTITY. A Slack allow-listed
        non-owner running ``!dashboard`` authenticates with ``app == ""`` and
        ``sub != owner_id``, so ordinary token auth admits them while
        ``is_owner_dashboard_request`` does not. Without the owner conjunct the
        grant would convert a clean 400-for-everyone into raw bytes for every
        authenticated caller -- widening the audience as a side effect of a control
        meant to narrow it, and contradicting the "owner's own authenticated
        browser" audience this class is scoped to.

        One function for both content kinds on purpose: a text file and a media
        file carrying the same credential reach the same audience through this

    removed every control character but CR, LF and TAB, while the raw string is

    It is refused HERE rather than inside ``validate_file_path`` because that is a

    What it buys at this boundary: the raw path is recorded in the request's audit
    entry and echoed in diagnostics, so CR or LF forges a line and ESC or an 8-bit
    C1 (U+009B CSI, U+0085 NEL) is a terminal escape. No file a dashboard caller
    means to open is named with one, so the refusal costs nothing legitimate --

    Groups the filesystem syscalls an endpoint needs before it can answer:
    ``validate_file_path``'s ``realpath`` plus linked-ancestor walk, and the
    ``isfile`` / ``isdir`` probe. One helper means one pool hop per request, and
    it means these cannot be reintroduced on the event loop a call at a time.

    Blocking by design, and unboundedly so: a path whose mount is unresponsive
    (a disconnected network share, a wedged FUSE filesystem) makes ``realpath``
    and ``stat`` block for however long the kernel takes, and those syscalls are
    uninterruptible. Run on the event loop, ONE such request stalls every
    endpoint in the process -- dashboard, tunnel, MCP and crons alike -- and a
    stall outlasting ``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs`` makes the loop
    watchdog kill the gateway. Which mount the path lands on is the caller's
    choice, not this process's.

    A ``ValueError`` from a malformed path (an embedded NUL makes ``realpath``
    raise) is deliberately NOT caught: it propagates exactly as it did when this
    ran inline, so no caller's answer for that input changes here.

    This probe is a verdict, not a handle. A caller that goes on to OPEN the path
    must not re-derive the descriptor from this answer in a second hop -- see
    :func:`_read_request_path` for why.

    Always reached through :func:`_run_path_probe`, never ``asyncio.to_thread``:
    a thread wedged in an uninterruptible ``stat`` never returns, so a caller
    repeatedly naming one dead mount would otherwise retire a default-executor
    worker per request until the rest of the gateway starves behind them. The
    dedicated pool caps the wedged threads and then refuses with 503, and no other
    ``to_thread`` user ever queues behind a probe.

    Blocking; callers run it on a worker thread. It exists because validating in
    one hop and opening in another is a symlink TOCTOU: between the two, the
    validated name can be replaced with a link into a location the validator
    would have refused, and a bare ``open`` then follows it. Whether the hops are
    two ``await``s or two statements, only ONE transaction closes that window.

    The transaction is :func:`_open_checked_file` -- the module's own
    open-and-check prefix, shared with file-raw, file-download, file-stream and
    file-sheet -- not a copy of it. That is the point: a later hardening fix to
    the prefix reaches this endpoint too, which a hand-rolled second copy would
    silently miss. Its ``is_sensitive_path`` rung is a re-check rather than a new
    gate here, because ``validate_file_path`` already applies that predicate; its
    ``except ValueError`` fold (an embedded NUL) is the prefix's decision for
    every adopter, and this endpoint now inherits it instead of answering that
    input differently from its four siblings.

    What stays endpoint POLICY, per the prefix's own contract: the ``isdir``
    probe, because a READ distinguishes a directory from a missing path in its
    404 (it runs inside the transaction for the same reason the open does), and
    the bounded byte snapshot used for both the binary verdict and text decode.
    One snapshot prevents an in-place rewrite between two reads from pairing a
    text verdict with binary bytes. The snapshot is ``read_cap * 4`` bytes (a
    UTF-8 character is at most four bytes), decoded whole and sliced to
    ``read_cap`` CHARACTERS, so multi-byte content does not mis-set
    ``X-Truncated`` and a character split at the byte bound can only fall
    beyond the slice. A file that itself ends mid-codepoint decodes to a
    trailing U+FFFD, exactly as it did before this change.

    Pass ``read_cap`` 0 for the verdict only: HEAD answers from the stat and must

    Whole-read adopters pass no cap here -- an fstat pre-check races a
    concurrent writer (the file can grow between the stat and the read),
    while their bounded read caps memory unconditionally.

    *log_open_failure* keeps log volume a per-endpoint decision: a
    caller-reachable open failure (mode-000 file, EACCES on a parent) writes
    a full traceback per request when True. The whole-read envelope wants
    that traceback (its 500 is the only signal); the streaming and sheet
    endpoints answer a coded refusal instead and pass False, so a request
    loop against a known-unreadable path cannot amplify into the log.

    Synchronous by design -- callers run it on a worker thread. Refusals are

    Split out of :func:`api_file_write` so the whole transaction runs OFF the
    event loop. Every call in here is a blocking filesystem call, and on a
    network-backed path (an SMB share, a stalled FUSE mount) each one can take
    seconds, which on the loop thread freezes chat and the heartbeat alongside
    it. Being on a worker thread also re-arms the Windows rename retry inside
    ``atomic_write``, which deliberately degrades to a single attempt when it
    finds a running loop in its own thread.

    Routing through ``open_access_control_source`` rather than a bare ``os.open``
    is what keeps this working on Windows: it returns ``None`` where the xattr
    syscalls do not exist, and a read handle held open across the write would
    make ``os.replace`` fail with ``PermissionError`` on every save there.

    ``path`` is already canonicalized by ``_validate_dashboard_path``
    (``realpath``), so its final component is symlink-free and the helper's
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` rejects nothing legitimate -- it closes the window where that

    target rather than a server fault, hence ``"notfound"`` and not an exception.

# ── Path completion (/api/path-complete) ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# The chat composer's shell-style `./` / `../` completion. A sibling of
# ``api_file_search`` above rather than a mode of it, for two reasons that are
# not cosmetic:
#
# * ``/api/file-search`` answers "which files ANYWHERE under this root fuzzily
#   match these characters"; completion answers "what is IN this one directory".
#   A recursive fuzzy hit cannot be turned back into the path the user is typing
#   -- the entry name alone is not the path -- so the row set has to come from a
#   single directory level.
# * ``?project=`` on the search endpoint is any path on the host, by design.
#   Completion must be the opposite: the caller names a KNOWN project directory
#   (the same allow-list ``api_project_git`` / ``api_project_tree`` use) and the
#   ``../`` segments are resolved and then re-checked for containment, so no
#   token typed in the composer can enumerate a directory outside the project.

#: Rows returned by one completion request. The composer popup shows a handful;
#: this bounds the response for a directory with thousands of entries, which is
#: also where a shell's own completion stops being useful.
_PATH_COMPLETE_MAX_ENTRIES = 50

#: Either separator ends a segment of a typed path token. Both, on every platform:
#: a backslash IS a separator on Windows, so a token carrying one must be SPLIT
#: rather than appended as a single literal name that the OS then re-interprets at
#: the open -- which is how `..\..\etc` escaped a root that had already been
#: checked. The composer's own grammar is POSIX-style, so on POSIX this only
#: refuses to treat a backslash as part of a filename, which no completion token
#: means it to be.
_PATH_TOKEN_SEPARATORS = re.compile(r"[/\\]+")

#: Directory entries EXAMINED per request, independent of how many survive the
#: prefix filter. The listing is one level deep, so this is the only ceiling
#: needed -- it bounds ``node_modules``-sized directories, where the scan (not
#: the response) is the cost.

    ``None`` means it does not name anything under the root: an absolute,
    drive-absolute or UNC-shaped prefix, or a ``..`` run that ends up outside it.
    This is the WHOLE containment decision and it touches no filesystem, which is
    what lets everything below refuse to resolve a caller-supplied string at all.

    The walk starts from the root's OWN segments rather than from empty, so a
    ``..`` run is judged on where it ends rather than refused for existing: going
    up and back down into the same project (``../<project-name>/src/``) is what a
    shell does and stays inside, while a run that ends anywhere else does not.
    Comparison is by segment, so no component is resolved to decide it.

    Both separators end a segment, on every platform -- see
    ``_PATH_TOKEN_SEPARATORS`` for why a Windows-style token must be split here
    rather than left for the OS to re-interpret after the check. A Windows
    component is also refused when trailing dots or spaces would be STRIPPED from
    it, for the same reason in miniature: ``".. "`` is not ``".."`` to this
    function but is to Win32, so accepting it would let the check and the OS
    disagree about one string. That rule applies to ORDINARY names only -- ``.``
    and ``..`` are parent references handled first, and ``".."`` would itself be
    stripped to nothing. Padded names are unopenable on Windows anyway, so the
    refusal costs nothing real; on POSIX they are ordinary filenames and are kept.

    Every filesystem touch for the request lives here (the project dir's own
    canonicalization, the component walk, ``scandir`` and the per-entry ``stat``),
    same shape as ``_resolve_project_git``: a project on a stalled mount must not
    block the loop on any of them.

    Returns ``(status, root, rows)`` with status ``"ok"``, ``"sensitive"``,
    ``"outside"`` (the token resolved out of the project), ``"refused"`` (a link
    or a non-directory sat at the target when it was opened, or the opened
    descriptor could not be identified) or ``"missing"`` (nothing is there). The
    last two are one answer to the caller and two different audit facts, which is
    why they are separate statuses.

    Nothing caller-supplied is ever RESOLVED. Containment is decided lexically by
    :func:`_completion_segments` -- an absolute, drive-absolute or UNC-shaped
    ``rel``, or a ``..`` run that pops above the root, names nothing under it --
    and the directory is then reached by :func:`_open_completion_dir`, which opens
    one component at a time and refuses to follow a link at any of them. So the
    target is under the root by construction rather than by a check, and a link a
    same-UID writer plants mid-walk is refused rather than followed. That is why
    ``realpath`` appears nowhere below: on Windows it opens the final path, so
    resolving a caller-influenced path whose link target is a share is itself an
    outbound SMB authentication, and any screen placed before it can only narrow
    the window rather than close it.

    known about a driver at all. Both refuse -- neither can be proven safe --
    but they are different facts and the reader is told the one that applies:
    collapsing them onto one message made the common case (an LFS repo) read as
    a disjunction the caller had already resolved.

    Mirrors ``worktree.py::_checkout_filter``: drivers can only come from a
    config file the repository supplies — ``--local`` (``.git/config``) and,
    when ``extensions.worktreeConfig`` is on, ``--worktree``
    (``$GIT_DIR/config.worktree``). The worktree scope is PROBED FIRST and a

    a probe that failed because the file is genuinely absent is the empty
    scope, not an unreadable one — while an existence pre-check would drop
    the scope on a stale fact and never look at a file git goes on to read.
    ``--includes`` is mandatory: a specific-scope
    query defaults include-following OFF, so a driver reached through
    ``include.path`` would be invisible to the probe yet still execute.
    Global/system config is deliberately not probed (the user's own machine
    setup, e.g. ``git lfs install``, is not repository-supplied). Any other
