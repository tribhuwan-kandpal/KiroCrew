    ``mcp.json``, the Kiro Crew store, and the row's own aggregate ``disabled``
    flag (``list_servers`` sets it from every scope) -- and a disabled row reads
    ``status: "disabled"``; ``kirocrewManaged`` says whether the store holds the
    entry, which is what gates the table's Edit action.

    ``disabledIn`` says WHICH scope switched the row off, because the table's
    two disabled states need opposite controls and cannot be told apart from
    ``enabled`` + ``kirocrewManaged``: ``"kirocrew"`` is a disable in Kiro
    Crew's own store, which the Kiro Crew scope badge + Apply lifts (the consent
    step); ``"shared"`` is a disable in a config this panel does not write for
    enable -- the shared Kiro ``mcp.json`` the IDE edits, or a provider global
    -- so the row is inert here. A row disabled in BOTH reads ``"shared"``:
    lifting the store's flag would leave the shared flag standing, so offering
    the consent step would offer a re-enable that cannot land. The same rule
    holds when the shared flag sits in a provider global this helper never
    reads: ``list_servers`` records that verdict on the row (``disabledInShared``,
    consumed here), so a store disable never masks it. ``None`` when
    enabled. ``disabledInFile`` names the file to edit (``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``,
    the constant display form -- never resolved here) when the shared flag is
    the Kiro-global one; ``None`` otherwise, including a disable only the
    aggregate flag reports (a provider global), which the table words as "the
    shared MCP config".

    Both maps are read by the ONE key the row stands for
    (:func:`_config_entry_for`): its exact key, else the single raw key whose
    alias it is (``npm:@playwright/mcp`` for the row ``playwright-mcp``). An
    ambiguous name stamps nothing from that map; the row's own aggregate flags
    still carry the disable.

    Pure: no filesystem call -- not a stat, not a home-directory resolution --
    because this runs on the event loop for every row of every listing and probe
    response. The pin is ``test_stamp_config_state_never_touches_the_filesystem``.

    Every "is it off" read here is :func:`mcp_entry_is_muted`, the launch
    predicate the gateway rewriter, the session projections and
    ``list_servers`` share -- FAIL-CLOSED, so ``"disabled": "false"`` (a string)
    is a disable, not a switch that failed to take. A row muted by such a value
    also carries ``disabledReason: "invalid"`` (``None`` otherwise): for the
    Kiro-global and store scopes it is read off the value in hand; for a disable
    only the aggregate flag reports, it is ``list_servers``' own verdict over
    the scopes it read. The table then says "invalid value in <file>", because
    the operator's fix is to repair the value, not to flip a switch.

    One helper for ``GET /api/mcp`` AND both probe paths, because the probe
    response REPLACES the table's list on the client rather than overlaying it.
    Stamped from the global file alone, a probe row for a store-disabled server
    came back ``enabled: true`` and flipped the row live until the next GET, and
    a row without ``kirocrewManaged`` lost its Edit action for the same interval.

    Either map may come from a hand-edited file whose ``mcpServers`` is not a
    mapping; a non-dict reads as an empty map rather than failing the whole

    The compensation for package-first ordering: Phase 1 removes the companion
    package before Phase 2 removes its persisted config, so if the apply is
    interrupted between them (an earlier change's write raised, OR the request
    task was cancelled — e.g. gateway shutdown / client disconnect — during
    Phase 1, before the Phase-2 lock is ever taken) the config would dangle at
    an already-removed package.

    Sweeps by REQUEST, not by companion outcome. Phase 2's own uninstall branch
    removes config unconditionally for every ``uninstall`` change (it does not
    consult ``capability_results``), so the sweep mirrors that: any requested
    uninstall the loop did not reach (not in ``purged_names``) gets its config
    removed. Keying on the request — rather than on a ``capability_results`` entry
    that a cancellation could leave unset the instant AFTER the companion removed
    the package — closes the "package gone, result unrecorded, config kept"
    window at the root. Removing config for a requested uninstall is the user's
    intent anyway, and errs toward the BENIGN failure direction (config gone,
    package possibly orphaned-but-harmless — recoverable by reinstall) rather
    than the harmful one (config kept, package gone → broken at every session).

    SYNCHRONOUS by design and dispatched to a worker thread by the caller (the

    it) and run-to-completion (a worker thread is not cancelled when the request
    task is). It uses its OWN synchronous lock, so it is correct whether or not
    the caller still holds the async lock (the Phase-2 ``async with`` has already
    exited by the time we reach here, and on a Phase-1 cancel it was never taken).

    Resolves from the MERGED effective view (base + ``config.local.json``), not
    from *section* alone: a legacy allowlist commonly lives in the user-owned
    overlay, and freezing from the base would write an EMPTY ``stub_servers``.
    Because key PRESENCE wins in ``_resolve_stub_servers``, that empty base value
    then beats the overlay's allowlist and silently unstubs servers the operator
    never touched. The frozen value is still written to the BASE section — the
    caller owns ``config.json`` — but it is computed from what the runtime reads.

    ``_resolve_stub_servers`` is deliberately conditional on ``enabled``: a legacy
    config carrying ``poolable_servers`` with ``enabled: false`` must resolve to an
    EMPTY stub set, so an upgrade never invents a daemon for an install whose
    gateway was off. The cost of that correctness is that the resolved value is
    UNSTABLE across a change to ``enabled`` — so a writer that leaves the file
    still riding the deprecated alias hands the NEXT read a different stub set
    than the operator was looking at when they clicked.

    Both directions were reachable through the sharing toggle alone:

    * ON, from ``enabled:false, poolable_servers:[X]`` — the page truthfully says
      "0 stubbed", and one click on *sharing* would stub every alias entry and
      share it, the unrequested-topology change this design exists to make opt-in.
    * OFF, from ``enabled:true, poolable_servers:[X]`` — the alias stops firing and
      the stub set empties, so "stubbed but private" becomes unreachable for
      exactly the migrated operator, and turning sharing off does more than narrow.

    Freezing on every write closes both: afterwards the file always carries an
    explicit ``stub_servers``, key presence wins in the resolver, and ``enabled``
    goes back to meaning only "share these backends". Ordering is load-bearing —
    freezing after ``enabled`` had been reassigned would resolve against the NEW
    value and bake in the very set this prevents.

    Absent-key test, not truthiness: an operator who wrote ``stub_servers: []``
    chose to stub nothing, and overwriting that from a stale ``poolable_servers``
    would re-stub servers they had just cleared.

    Deduplicates: the resolver preserves whatever the file held, and a
    ``poolable_servers`` carrying the same name twice would otherwise be frozen
    with the duplicate and make the dashboard's ``stub_count`` overcount.

    THE eligibility rule, and the only copy of it. The caller passes the sharing
    state it read under the config lock, so the answer describes the fleet as the
    write about to happen will find it -- not as a client saw it when a person
    started composing the batch. A client that resolved this itself could only
    ever answer for an earlier moment: sharing is a separate switch another
    dashboard or the CLI can flip, and every guard against that window closes the
    window rather than the gap it comes from.

    Returns ``(eligible, skipped)`` where each skip carries the reason code the
    operator needs to understand a count they did not expect. Reasons:

    - ``unknown`` -- not in any agent spec, so there is nothing to stub
    - ``cannot_stub`` -- HTTP/SSE (no stdio pipe to interpose on) or denylisted
    - ``pooling_blocked_by_env`` -- sharing is on and the rewriter would leave this
      entry unwrapped to avoid withholding a declared key, so stubbing it would
      report work the broker never does
    - ``evidence_insufficient`` -- the verdict does not recommend the operation
      being asked for, INCLUDING when the stored measurement describes a program
      this name no longer launches

    With sharing ON the question is ``recommend_share``, because a stub joins a
    pooled backend and co-tenancy is what needs supporting. With sharing OFF a
    stub pools nothing, so ``recommend_stub`` is the honest bar; asking for the
    stricter one there would make the gesture stub nothing at all in the
    configuration most operators are in.

    The two kinds of evidence are read differently, because they push opposite
    ways. A PREFLIGHT can promote a server and enable co-tenancy, so it is read
    through ``VerdictCache.get`` with the server's CURRENT identity, and only when
    every definition under that name resolves to the SAME identity: a row is keyed
    by name, so a replaced command keeps the previous measurement until the next
    probe overwrites it, and two agents declaring one name differently mean no
    single row describes what this write would stub. Either way a mismatch reads
    as no measurement, which is the same fail-closed answer as never having
    probed. HAZARDS only ever demote, so they are read name-wide rather than
    identity-filtered -- restricting them to the current identity would DISCARD a
    recorded objection and read as promotion.

    Body ``{"name": "slack-mcp", "stub": true}`` for one server, or

    removes those names from ``mcp_gateway.stub_servers`` in config.json
    (same config lock + atomic write as the enable toggle).  The change is
    RECORDED, not applied: the running broker is left alone and the response
    carries ``restart_required``, because the daemon's routing is built with the
    agent-spec rewrite at startup and a session's MCP toolset is fixed at
    ``session/new``.  When the gateway is disabled, the allowlist is persisted
    only (it takes effect when the gateway is enabled).

    The batch form exists because the UI's "toggle all" would otherwise issue
    one request per server: N config rewrites for a single user gesture, each
    one racing the others for the config lock.  One request
    means one write and one apply, so the allowlist can never land half-flipped.

    ``resolve_eligibility: true`` (with ``stub: true``) hands the POLICY to this
    handler: the caller sends candidate names and the server decides which ones
    the evidence allows, inside the same lock hold that writes them. The response
    then reports ``stubbed`` and ``skipped`` (with a reason per name) instead of
    echoing the request, because the two deliberately differ.

    Returns ``{ok, name, stub, ...}`` for the single form and
