"""MCP Apps handlers — the UI→gateway tool-callback relay (SEP-1865).

``POST /api/mcp-apps/call`` lets an embedded MCP App iframe invoke one of its
server's *app-visible* tools. The dashboard is a thin relay: it validates the
request shape, performs a cheap local capability pre-check (the spool record
must exist), and forwards a one-shot ``app-call`` control frame over the
gateway's uid-gated unix socket. ALL authorization decisions — spool-token
re-verification, backend routing, ``_meta.ui.visibility`` enforcement, SEL
auditing — happen gateway-side in :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.app_call`, so a
bug here cannot grant an app a tool the gateway would refuse.

Body: ``{"spool_id": str, "tool": str, "arguments": {..}}``.
Replies: 200 ``{"result": ...}`` / ``{"error": ...}`` (backend JSON-RPC error),
403 for gateway policy rejections, 404 for unknown/expired spool ids,
503 when gatewayd is unreachable, 504 on timeout.

    Returns ``(record, caller_session, None)`` when the request may proceed, or

    in order:

    1. AUTHENTICATED owner (the token-auth middleware's ``request["user"]`` /
       ``request["app"]``, never a client-set header) — app tokens and
       non-owner subjects are refused: an embedded app's capability must only
       ever be exercised by the owner's own dashboard.
    2. Ephemeral gate: incognito/guest sessions must not be able to exercise a
       (leaked or shoulder-surfed) spool capability — the same server-side gate
       memory operations use.
    3. Capability pre-check: the spool record must exist. ``to_thread``:
       records can be multi-MB and this runs on the dashboard event loop.
    4. Session-ownership binding. The record names the session that PRODUCED
       the app — its own key, which is ``dashboard:<slot>`` for a
       dashboard-born session and the channel's own key for one that started
       on a channel — while the honest client echoes the bare slot key.
       Canonicalize the caller's spelling or a legitimate owner is always
       refused as a mismatch. Which canonical form is correct is a property of
       the slot, not of the string: prefixing a channel-born key yields
       ``dashboard:slack:<ts>``, a key no session ever has. So ask the slot
       the caller named what session it runs, the same rule the render side
       binds on, and fall back to the prefix form when no such slot is open.
       Still fail-closed: identity is a single-valued function of the key the
       caller supplied, the accepted set stays two spellings of that one key,
       and the binding read here is written server-side from the session map —
       a caller can only ever resolve to the session it already claims to be.
       Records without a session binding fall through (for ``/call``, the
       gateway's own ladder still applies).

    Every denial is SEL-audited — an unknown/expired spool id or a foreign
    session key reaching an app-capability endpoint is a denied capability
    presentation worth the trail.
