"""HTTP routes for the conductor work ledger — the shared record between a
conductor session and the worker sessions it dispatched.

Thin mapping over :mod:`kiro_crew.work_ledger`, and the security contract is the
one :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.session_ledger` states: which ledger a
request touches is derived from the CALLING SESSION's identity
(``X-Session-Key``, vetted by ``_recognize_session``), never from the request
body. That is what makes the four tools' identity unforgeable — a worker has no
parameter naming its item, its conductor, or itself, so an out-of-bounds write is
unrepresentable rather than validated away.

Which half of the surface answers a call depends on what the caller RESOLVES to,
not on which spec mounted the tool:

===============================  =========================  ==========================
resolved caller                  ``brief`` / ``report``     ``read`` / ``record``
===============================  =========================  ==========================
a binding file, no ledger dir    available                  ``no_ledger`` (404)
a ledger dir, no binding file    ``not_bound`` (403)        available
both — a second-level conductor  available                  available
neither                          ``not_bound`` (403)        ``no_ledger`` (404)
===============================  =========================  ==========================

All four routes are MCP-only (no browser caller) and listed under
``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` by their shared ``/api/work-ledger``
prefix — without that entry the internal-secret call falls through to cookie auth
and every tool call fails with 403 before this module's own recognition can run.

Restricted (incognito / temporary / guest) sessions are refused: a ledger is
durable on-disk state, which is exactly what those modes promise not to leave
behind.

One spelling note that is load-bearing. Every key — the caller's own, and the
``worker_session_key`` a conductor supplies at ``bind`` — is folded through
:func:`session_ledger.ledger_key` before it reaches the store. One dashboard
session is legitimately spelled both ``dashboard_chat-X`` and ``chat-X``, so
without the fold a conductor could bind the spelling ``session_create`` returned
while the worker resolves the other one, and the worker would read ``not_bound``
against a binding that exists.
