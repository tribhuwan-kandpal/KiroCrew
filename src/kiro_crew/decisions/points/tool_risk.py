"""``tool.risk`` -- how risky is the tool call this session is about to run?

An ANNOTATION, and nothing else. The permission DECISION is not consulted and not
altered: the answer becomes a badge on the tool card and a row in the decision
log, and a call the policy allows is still allowed with the tier ``risky`` on it,
while a call the policy refuses is still refused with ``safe`` on it. That is the
whole contract, and it is the reason this point may run at all -- an oracle answer
is an observation, and an observation must never become a gate.

Two things the contract does NOT claim, because neither is true. It is not free of
TIMING: the caller awaits this point in the ``tool_call`` branch, which the harness
sends BEFORE it asks for permission, so a sampled call's approval is answered up to
the wait budget later than it otherwise would be. And a badge is not a verdict on
whether the call ran -- a host gate, a ``PreToolUse`` hook or a batch cascade can
refuse a call that already carries one, and the SEL tool-invocation audit is where
that outcome is recorded. What is unchanged is the decision itself: same inputs,
same branches, same answer.

Why it only runs where nothing asks the human
---------------------------------------------
The caller gates on the session AUTO-APPROVING its tool calls (``trust`` or
YOLO). In a session that prompts, the human reads the call and is the
annotation; adding a second opinion to a card they are already judging would be
noise beside a control. In a trusting session nothing stops to describe what is
about to run, so a badge is the only signal there is, and the only place a reader
learns that the seam looked at all.

What ``policy`` on the row means, and what it deliberately does not
------------------------------------------------------------------
``policy`` is the grant that answers this call -- ``yolo``, ``trust`` or
``trust_scope``, the caller's own descriptive spelling. It is NOT a per-call
verdict, and it cannot be: the harness sends the ``tool_call`` notification
BEFORE it asks for permission (``acp/_dispatch.permission_event``, "the preceding
``tool_call`` notification"), so the card this record rides exists before any
verdict about it does. A later refusal -- a host gate, a ``PreToolUse`` hook, a
batch cascade -- is recorded by the SEL tool-invocation audit, which is where a
per-call outcome already lives. Putting a guess at it here would give the log two
descriptions of one call and make the weaker one look authoritative.

A SECOND consent, not a wider reading of the first
-------------------------------------------------
This point sends a category ``skills.select`` never did -- the tool's name and its
arguments -- so consent to send is not consent to send this. The keystone records
the two separately (``consent.consented_tool_args``), absent reads as NOT
consented, and ``gate._scope_consented`` refuses the point without it. An install
that consented before the scope existed is therefore INERT here rather than
retroactively signed up, which is the same argument that gave
``history_budget_chars`` a keystone ceiling instead of a config value.

Everything is a refusal back to "no badge"
------------------------------------------
:func:`risk_record` returns ``None`` for: the seam off, the session unsampled, the
tool-argument scope not consented to, the turn cap reached, a scrubbed or failed
call, an unusable answer, a ``safe`` verdict, a ``caution`` or ``risky`` verdict the
provider was not confident about, and a ``caution`` on a plain file write. So an
ordinary tool card is byte-identical to the one this build appends today, and a
caller needs no try/except and no feature check.

``safe`` is a refusal to BADGE, not a refusal to record: the row is written with
``tier="safe"``, because "the seam looked and thought it was fine" is the answer
that makes the other two readable, and a badge on every card would cost the
annotation its meaning.

An unconvinced answer in EITHER flagged tier is refused the same way and recorded
the same way. The tier is not the flag on its own: ``p`` is the probability the
provider assigned to the option it CHOSE, so an answer at 0.5 is a coin flip about
which tier the call is even in, and :data:`CAUTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` and
:data:`RISKY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` are where this build stops printing one. A plain
file write or edit (:func:`kiro_crew.platform.tool_paths.is_edit_call`) never draws
a ``caution`` badge at all. The row still carries the tier it was given either way,
so the suppressed answers stay countable -- which is how both thresholds were
measured and the only way the next ones can be.

The two bars are equal in value and separate in identity, because they are read off
two different populations and the next reading may move one without the other.

Two bounds, because a turn can call many tools
---------------------------------------------
One oracle call per tool call, and at most :data:`MAX_CALLS_PER_TURN` per turn.
The wait is the same shape every point uses (``timeout_secs`` plus
:data:`WAIT_MARGIN_SECS`, clamped into :data:`MIN_WAIT_SECS` ..
:data:`MAX_WAIT_SECS`); the per-turn cap is what keeps a tool-heavy turn from
spending that budget twenty, or two hundred, times over. The call that CROSSES
the cap writes one row saying so, so a reader can tell "this turn stopped being
annotated" from "this turn was never sampled"; the calls after it write nothing.

#:
#: 0.80, and measured rather than picked. Over this build's own day-files -- 40
#: answered ``risky`` calls, median 0.795, so the tier does NOT arrive confident --
#: every answer at or above 0.80 named a push, a force-push, an upload or an
#: opened pull request, which is what the rubric's own sentence asks for. The
#: answers below 0.62 were a queued monitor edit, a message to another session and
#: a comment posted on a pull request: none of those destroy data, touch
#: credentials or leave the workspace, and a badge that fires on them is the
#: failure mode a badge has. 0.90 was measured too and REJECTED -- it drops eleven
#: of the true ones, force-pushes and a credential fix among them, and a flag that
#: misses a force-push is worse than no flag. The clean part of the reading is the
#: gap: nothing was answered between 0.62 and 0.76.
#:
#: n was 40, so this is a floor with evidence rather than a tuned optimum, and the
#: suppressed rows are what a later reading re-derives it from.
#:
#: A CONSTANT, not a setting, for the reason ``memory_recall.KEEP_THRESHOLD`` is
#: one: it is the meaning of the answer rather than a knob, and a configurable
#: threshold would be a second, undocumented way to make the point a no-op
#: (``1.0`` badges nothing) without turning the seam off.

#: across 0.3..1.0 and bunched between 0.5 and 0.8, so a tier-only rule printed a
#: badge on nearly every hesitant one. Replaying those rows with ``caution``
#: needing 0.90, ``risky`` keeping 0.80 and file writes never drawing ``caution``
#: leaves about 490 badges (-68%). The bar sits HIGHER than ``risky``'s on
#: purpose: ``caution`` is the mild word, so a missed one costs a reader little
#: and a noisy one costs every badge its meaning. Raising ``risky`` to 0.90 in the
#: same replay would have kept 33 of 86 push / force-push calls instead of 61,
#: which is why that bar did not move.
#:
#: A CONSTANT for the same reason :data:`RISKY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` is one.
CAUTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.90

#: A plain file write or edit never draws a ``caution`` badge: writing a file
#: inside the workspace is what the rubric's ``caution`` sentence describes, so
#: the badge said nothing a reader of the card did not already know -- in that
#: same reading 477 of 1,527 badges (31%) were "Write File" at ``caution``.
#: ``risky`` still badges on a write, because a write outside the workspace or
#: over a credential file is exactly what ``risky`` is for. Whether a call IS
#: that write is :func:`kiro_crew.platform.tool_paths.is_edit_call`, the same
#: routing predicate the hook edit gate and governance classification share --
#: not a second, private reading of what an edit is keyed on the ACP ``kind``
#: alone, which the harness marks agent-influenced and can arrive empty or as
