"""Contribution protocol: the gateway side of an out-of-process contributor.

Implements ``docs/system-specs/modules/contribution-protocol.md``. Three pieces
live here, and the HTTP handlers, the WebSocket hub and app teardown are thin
callers of them:

``UnitRegistry``
    Which unit kinds have a log. A kind is a REGISTRATION -- ``{kind, id_field,
    frame, service}`` -- so adding a second kind is one ``register_unit`` call
    rather than a rewrite of the routes. Today: ``member``.

``ExternalProjectionStore``
    One row per ``(kind, id, key)`` published from outside, with higher-seq-wins
    and a ``stateVersion`` override, plus an optional render schema per key.
    Durable, because a contributor publishes at its own cadence: an in-memory
    table would drop every contributed card on a gateway restart and leave the
    Members page blank until the contributor happened to re-fold.

``EventBudget``
    Per app, per unit, per UTC day. Deliberately process memory: the budget
    bounds one gateway's exposure to a runaway contributor, and a restart is
    already the loudest possible signal that the process is not the one that
    counted. Persisting it would buy a stricter bound on a resource (log bytes)
    that the 64 KiB per-event cap already bounds.

Nothing here executes contributor code. A contributor reads events, folds in its
own process, and publishes whole values; the gateway stays the only writer of
every log.

#: holding a wildcard ``<app>/*`` grant can publish a new unique key forever and

#: leaves the store bounded.

#: -- and nothing measured it. A key is an ``<app>/<name>`` identifier a person
#: reads on a card, so this is generous for every legitimate one.
MAX_PROJECTION_KEY_CHARS = 128

#: Largest the on-disk projection file for one unit may be. Enforced on BOTH

#: file over it. Derived rather than picked, and the multiplier is the number of
#: distinct contributing APPS one unit is budgeted for -- the per-app key ceiling
#: bounds each app at keys-per-app-unit times value-bytes, so eight maximally
#: loaded apps reach this number and JSON framing comes out of the same budget.
#: A ninth app, or eight full ones plus framing, is refused at the write door
#: rather than stored as a file no later load will accept. The file is written by
#: this store, but it lives in the data home where it can be hand-edited, so the
#: loader may not assume its size either.
MAX_PROJECTION_STORE_BYTES = 8 * MAX_PROJECTION_KEYS_PER_APP_UNIT * MAX_PROJECTION_VALUE_BYTES

#: Maximum nesting depth of an event ``data`` or a projection ``value``.
