"""MemberEventLogService — the one door to per-member append-only logs.

Contract (implemented in this module; callers import only from here):

    svc = get_service()                       # lazy singleton rooted at the member crew log root
    svc.attach_broadcast(state.broadcast_ws)  # once, at dashboard startup
    svc.ensure(slug, name)                    # create the log + header if missing (migrates legacy files)
    ev = svc.append(slug, type, data)         # write + fsync, fold projections, push member_projection frames
    svc.snapshot(slug)                        # {"asOfSeq": int, "values": {key: view}}
    svc.history(slug, before=None, limit=50)  # newest-first page of envelopes
    svc.last_seq(slug)                        # 0 for an empty log
    svc.last_seqs()                           # {slug: last_seq} for every known log
    svc.slugs()                               # every member with a log on disk

All methods are synchronous. A write is one line appended under a per-slug
lock and fsync'd before it returns; projections fold in the same call and the
broadcast is only enqueued. Callers on the event loop pay one fsync per
append, which is the pilot's accepted cost.

    alone both leaves the history on disk and re-arms the fold, because the next

    fold reads is covered: the live file, its one rotation, and the retired names
    the fold renames them to.

    **The directory name is checked AS WRITTEN, before anything resolves it, and
    the leaves are derived from that unwritten-through path.** ``member_dir``
    resolves and then only containment-checks the result, so ``members/<slug>``
    swapped for a link to a PEER's directory resolves inside the members root,
    passes that check, and hands back the peer's real directory -- where these four
    names are ordinary files, so a link test on the leaves is false and the unlink
    destroys a live member's history. For a member whose fold has not run that file
    is the sole copy. ``members/<slug>`` is deliberately agent-writable, which is
    what makes the swap reachable rather than hypothetical, and
    ``crew_log.store.remove_unit`` refuses the same shape for the same reason. The
    leaf test is kept as well: it costs nothing and covers a single file swapped for
    a link without the directory being touched.

    **Both tests are ``session_ledger.is_link``, which answers for a Windows
    JUNCTION as well as a symlink.** ``is_symlink`` is false for a junction, so it
    would read one as a real directory and follow it -- and a junction needs no
    privilege to create, which puts the swap above within reach of the same writer
    that owns this agent-writable directory. That predicate is what the sibling
    removal in ``crew_log.store`` screens its own written name with, for this
    reason.

    still removed, because the member's record is already gone and a cleanup must

    The legacy path is AGENT-WRITABLE -- that is this module's own premise for
    keeping the completion marker in the fenced log root instead -- and the fold
    runs inside ``ensure`` under the per-slug lock, which the roster request path
    calls. So the party the marker defends against also chooses what KIND of
    thing sits at this path, and a plain ``open`` trusts that choice twice:

    * a FIFO blocks the open until a writer appears, which no writer ever has to
      be. That stalls the fold, the lock, and the request behind it, and it
      outlives a restart: the hang happens BEFORE the marker can be written, so
      the FIFO survives and the marker never lands.
    * a symlink redirects the read somewhere the member directory does not own.

    ``platform_compat.open_file_no_reparse`` is that open, named: ``O_NONBLOCK``
    makes the FIFO open return at once instead of waiting, and the ``fstat`` then
    refuses it for what it is, while the reparse-point refusal is settled in the
    SAME operation that opens -- on POSIX by ``O_NOFOLLOW``, and on Windows by
    ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT``, because Windows has no ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and a
    feature-detected ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)`` is therefore 0 there. The
    regular-file check does NOT cover that case: a link whose target is a regular
    file passes ``S_ISREG`` while the read has already been redirected. On a
    regular file ``O_NONBLOCK`` changes nothing about the reads.

    ``None`` means ONLY "this file is not something to migrate from" -- it does not
    exist, or it is not a regular file. A genuine I/O FAILURE is raised instead of
    being folded into ``None``, and the difference decides whether rows are lost:
    the caller keeps ``complete`` true when there is nothing to migrate, and the
    retirement it then writes is permanent and never re-runs the fold. If a transient
    open failure (EMFILE, a permission blip, an unresponsive mount) were reported as
    absence, the rows in an existing file would be retired UNREAD, with no recovery.

        A closer is decided from a SNAPSHOT and written afterwards, and between those
        two the state it describes can legitimately change: the startup reconcile runs
        as a background task concurrent with the gateway going live, so a slot it read
        as durably open can be reopened, or a patrol re-armed, by a live writer before
        the closer lands. The log is append-only with no compaction, so a closer that
        lands after a live open is a permanent regression of the projection -- and not
        a self-correcting one, because a later restart's reconcile reads the state as
        closed and has no reason to reopen it.

        ``still_applies`` is therefore re-asked HERE, under the lock that writes, and
        is handed the CURRENT projection values rather than the caller's snapshot.
        ``_get_log`` has already folded anything a concurrent writer committed, so
        those values include the live change the caller could not have seen. Returns
        ``None`` when the closer does not apply, which is a normal outcome and not
        a failure: it means the state closed itself while the reconcile was deciding.

        It is handed ``observed`` -- the values the caller DECIDED on -- as a second
        argument, because the current state alone cannot answer the question. The
        state is not the episode: a patrol that stopped and was RE-ARMED in this
        window reads ``armed`` exactly like the original episode the caller meant to
        close, so a predicate that tests only the current state stamps the NEW
        episode with the OLD one's closer, and the fresh patrol then reads as
        stopped. Comparing against ``observed`` is what tells those two apart.

        Note what is deliberately NOT done: refusing whenever the projection sequence
        advanced. ``snapshot`` reports one ``asOfSeq`` for the whole slug -- the max
        across every projection cell -- and ``_get_log`` folds all pending commits
        first, so ANY unrelated event on the member advances it and a closer gated on
        it would essentially never fire. The comparison belongs on the projection
        block the closer concerns, which is why the predicate makes it and not this
        method.

        This exists rather than a predicate on :meth:`append` because the predicate
        must not re-enter the service to read state -- ``snapshot`` takes this same
        non-reentrant lock, so a caller that reached for it would deadlock.

        The member half of the door ``sessions._remove_session_crew_log`` is for
        sessions: a caller outside this package says WHICH member's history has no
        owner left, and this owns the two steps that knowledge implies -- the
        store's removal, and dropping what this service caches for that slug. A
        handler reaching into the store itself would do the first and forget the
        second, and a cached ``MemberLog`` that outlives its files answers reads
        for a member whose history is gone.

        *still_unclaimed* is the caller's reason, re-asked under the removal's own
        lease hold: the store calls it as the ``guard`` it requires. It takes no
        arguments because this reason is not a property of the file -- whether a
        member is still in the roster is a property of the config -- so re-reading
        the log here would answer a question nobody asked. Re-asking it at all is
        what the session sweep's guard is for: the caller decided outside the
        hold, and a same-name member committed in that window owns this very unit,
        because the unit is keyed by the slug and a recreated namesake derives the
        same one. The predicate answering false is an ordinary outcome, not a
        failure: nothing is removed and nothing is written.

        Called under the per-slug lock, so an append through this service is
        serialized against it rather than racing the unlink. The lock ENTRY is
        kept afterwards while the log and name caches are dropped: a later caller
        that found no entry would build a second lock for the same slug, and two
        threads holding different locks for one slug is worse than a dict entry
        for a member that is gone. Nothing else is dropped, because nothing else
        survives the removal as an answer -- the folded cells for this slug stay
        in the registry, and are unreachable through every read here, each of
        which returns empty once ``_get_log`` finds no file.

        **The legacy activity source goes with the unit, and that is what makes the
        removal mean anything.** Those rows are the member's own pre-log history,
        they live outside the unit under ``members/<slug>/``, and the marker saying
        they were already folded lives INSIDE it -- so a removal that took only the
        unit would leave the history on disk AND leave the next fresh ``ensure``
        free to fold it into a new log, in this process or any other writer's. Kept,
        they are the thing the delete was asked to remove; taken, a later append can
        recreate at most an empty header, which carries nothing. Best-effort and
        symlink-refusing, like every other step of this teardown: a name that will
        not go leaves the rest removed rather than failing a delete whose record is
        already gone.

        **A unit the store does not find still leaves that source behind, so the
        cleanup runs for an absent unit too -- and re-asks the roster itself.** A
        member whose log was never written, or whose fold has not run, has its
        history ONLY in that source, and skipping it there would leave the delete
        having removed nothing at all. The store calls the predicate as its guard
        only when there is a unit to hold, so for an absent one there is no answer
        to inherit and this asks again; the question raising rather than answering
        keeps the source, the same direction every other decision here takes.
