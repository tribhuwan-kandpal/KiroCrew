"""Shared channel turn pipeline — one copy of the dispatch skeleton.

This module owns the sequence every non-Slack channel dispatcher runs around
:class:`TurnDriver`:

    governance gate
    -> hook auto-reply                   (HOOK_REPLY short-circuits, no session)
    -> renderer.on_turn_start()          (typing indicator before cold start)
    -> sessions.get_or_create + set_channel
    -> publish_turn_identity
    -> ctx_builder.build_message         (off-loop, embeds block)
    -> TurnDriver.run                    (shared redaction + approval ladder)
    -> COMPACTION_FAILED: reset; replay once more if the failure was transient
                                         and nothing was emitted (bounded)
    -> post-turn: record_success, persist, threshold notice, SEL audit
                                         (each guarded independently)
    -> finally: renderer.close() + release (release gated on acquire)

What stays per-channel is what actually differs between them: the wire
protocol, event normalization, ``authorize()`` semantics, rendering, command
vocabulary, and the ack strings. Channels inject those through
:class:`ChannelTurn` rather than subclassing, so a capability this protocol
lacks widens the protocol once instead of forking the pipeline.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> messaging`` (never the reverse), so this
module must not import any channel package.

    ``crew_log_emit.on_session_opened`` is what CREATES a session's crew log, keyed
    by its ACP session id; ``chat_runner._run_chat`` calls it on every dashboard turn
    once the handle exists, and a warm reuse is silent. A channel conversation runs
    its own copy of the turn loop, and without this call it opens no log at all.
    That is a hole the work ledger falls into: the ledger is a projection of the
    crew log, every ``work_ledger_record`` / ``work_report`` write appends one
    ``work/recorded`` entry to the ACTING session's log, and a write with nowhere
    to append is rolled back and refused (``crew_log_unrecorded``). An owner DM
    that session control admits as a conductor therefore reached the ledger and
    lost every write to it. Opening the log here, before ``TurnDriver.run``, is
    what makes that admission usable. Free while the emitter is off -- the emitter
    checks its own flag -- and it never raises, because the turn must not be lost
    to its own record.

    Only facts the dispatcher can establish are recorded; the emitter reads an
    absent field as "not observed", never as false. The ACP session id comes off
    *provider* (no id, no log: a turn that never got a session emits nothing, as
    on the dashboard). ``slot`` is the key the dashboard surfaces this conversation
    under -- the channel key folded to the filename charset, which is what
    ``channel_slot_name`` spells and what ``session_create`` stamps as
    ``_created_by`` on the workers this session dispatches, so the session tree
    joins the two. The served model and the cwd are read off the provider, the
    dashboard's own sources for them; ``resumed`` is ``get_or_create``'s answer.
    The class is stated only when the memory mode is known, from the gateway's
    live policy for the key (``ctx_builder.live_memory_mode_for_session``, wired by
    the dashboard state; a builder without it states no class, which readers
    refuse rather than assume), and it carries ``channel=True`` because a
    channel-born conversation is published to its channel by definition -- the
    same reading ``_crew_log_class`` takes off a linked slot. No ``parent``: a
    conversation the person opened themselves is nobody's child. ``previous_sid``
    is the crew log this conversation was writing before this turn's allocation
    (:func:`predecessor_sid`, read by the dispatcher before ``get_or_create``):
    the emitter writes the ``previous`` edge only when it names a different
    store, which is what keeps a conversation's history reachable across the
    cold successor a failed compaction leaves behind.

    For the channel's OWN sessions only. A dashboard session resumed into the chat
    (``!sessions``) is opened by the dashboard runner, which alone holds its
