"""Redaction against what a chat platform will DISPLAY, not the bytes it is sent.

Every channel scans outbound text for credentials, but a scan of the literal
bytes is not enough on any platform that renders markup away: ``AKIA**REST**``
and ``[AKIA](https://x)REST`` match no credential pattern as written, yet the
reader sees an intact key once the delimiters are stripped at render time. The
transformation happens AFTER the scan, so the scan has to anticipate it.

This lives in ``messaging`` rather than in one channel package because the
hazard is not Slack-specific: Telegram (MarkdownV2) and Discord (Markdown)
collapse the same emphasis, code-span and link syntax. It was written for
Slack first and hoisted here when :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.renderer.
format_overflow` began putting LLM-authored choice text into the message BODY
on every widget-capable channel -- the shared sink cannot depend on each
renderer remembering to canonicalise, which is the same reasoning that put the
``max_buttons`` cap in shared code.

Stdlib-only leaf: it takes the redactor as a parameter rather than importing
``kiro_crew.security``, so it stays importable from anywhere and each caller
keeps its own (possibly session-scoped) redactor.

    A cap that cuts text into two messages is applied to the RAW string, while the
    reader sees the CANONICAL rendering of each piece. So a credential the model
    split with markup can be severed by the cut: each piece is scrubbed on its own
    and matches nothing, and the reader's client renders the markup away and
    rejoins the halves on screen.

    This answers the question directly rather than guessing which characters could
    hide such a split. Each side is put through the same redaction the sender will
    actually apply (:func:`redact_for_display`), then reduced to what the platform
    SHOWS (:func:`canonicalize_display`), and the result of putting the two sides
    together is scanned.

    Soundness, which is the whole point: ``redact_for_display`` already emits the
    canonical form whenever canonicalising reveals something the literal form hid,
    so ``redactor(canonicalize_display(redact_for_display(x)[0]))`` is a fixed
    point for any single string ``x``. Whatever this scan finds is therefore
    produced by putting the two sides together and by nothing else. No character
    class, no window and no
    anchor list: a search window built from a hand-written set of characters cannot
    be closed, because the next character the set does not know about is one more
    place a split can hide -- the walk that finds the window's edge stops there, the
    check runs on a span the credential's prefix was never inside, and it passes
    vacuously.

    BOTH readings a reader can produce are scanned, because neither one contains
    the other:

    * **canonicalise the join** models a COPY of both messages, and a client
      lenient about where one message ends. It is the wider reading for runs of
      delimiters, which concatenation can only extend: ``AKIA**`` beside
      ``**REST`` is a run only once the halves sit together.
    * **canonicalise each side, then join** models the screen -- two messages
      rendered separately, read one after the other. This is the wider reading
      wherever canonicalising DROPS text rather than just deleting delimiters,
      which is exactly what a link does to its target. A cut one character inside
      ``[l](https://x/AKIA`` + ``REST)`` completes the link only in the join,
      where the url then collapses to the label and the key vanishes from the
      scan -- while on screen each half is an unfinished link whose url stays
      visible, and the reader reads straight through it.

    So the join alone would pass a cut through a credential in a url, and the
    per-side reading alone would miss a credential split by markup at the
    boundary. Either reading finding something is enough to refuse the cut, and
    ``test_display_split_safety.py`` pins one shape per reading.

    renderer that strips steering markers, horizontal rules or surrounding whitespace
    on the way out delivers something shorter than the raw slice: grading the raw
    slice then accepts an offset whose delivered halves sit flush together. Worse than
    accepting it once -- the search is deterministic, so a caller that re-grades the

    segment never goes out at all. Default is identity, for a caller that delivers

    and :func:`joins_to_a_credential` is false of the delivered halves, so the reader

    one, and stepping past it merely defers a few more characters to the next

    attacker-influenced text on every frame; this is O(log *limit*), and the common
    case -- prose, where any cut is safe -- costs one pass, or none at all when *text*
    already fits.

    ``0`` means every SAMPLED candidate was unsafe -- one matched region covers all of
    them. A safe offset between two samples may still exist; the search does not look
    for it, because the answer it needs is only "is there a safe cut I can take now".

    and the reader's client renders the markup away and reads the pieces one under
    the other, in order, as one text.

    Two readings, because neither subsumes the other:

    * **the whole sequence**, every piece redacted alone and then put together. This
      is what catches a key whose MARKUP spans an entire piece rather than whose
      characters do: cut ``AKIA[KEYTAIL](http://host/<long>)`` into three and no
      neighbouring pair canonicalises to anything (the link needs its closing
      bracket, which is in the third piece), while the full join collapses the url
      to the label and puts the label against ``AKIA``. Piece length is no defence
      here -- canonicalising DROPS a link's target, so a piece of any size can
      vanish entirely.
    * **each boundary against everything after it**, which is the reading that
      survives a pattern needing a trailing boundary: the reader sees a message
      break where the whole-sequence join sees the next character, so a key
      completed at the end of one piece must be caught even when later text would
      spoil the match.

    Every piece is put through the same redaction the sender will apply and then

    does for a single cut -- of which this is the n-piece case. Soundness rests on
    the same property: ``redact_for_display`` is already a fixed point for one
    string, so whatever either reading finds is produced by putting pieces together
    and by nothing else. One piece therefore answers False: there is no boundary.

    Callers must pass the pieces AS DELIVERED, not as the splitter produced them. A
    renderer that strips steering markers, horizontal rules or surrounding
    whitespace on the way out delivers something shorter than it graded, and two
    pieces whose facing edges are whitespace become adjacent on screen -- where
    ``AKIAIOSF`` and ``    ODNN7EXAMPLE`` read as one key that no credential pattern
    tolerating no whitespace would have matched.

    A seam is graded when the cut is made, over the text present THEN. That is not a
    decision that keeps: canonicalising is non-local, so characters arriving later
    can change how earlier ones render. A message ending ``...AKIA`` beside a live
    tail of ``[KEYTAIL`` grades clean -- the link has no closing bracket yet -- and
    once it is sent it cannot be recalled; the bracket then arrives and the reader
    reads one key down the screen.

    So the boundary is graded again at every delivery, against the message already
    on screen. When the join reveals a key, the remedy has to act on the PENDING
    side, because that is the only side still in hand. The join is redacted as one
    string and everything past the surviving prefix of *delivered* is what goes out:
    the placeholder lands where the match began, so the half already shown is left
    stranded on its own, which is not a credential.

    Withholding is NOT an alternative here. The text must be delivered eventually,
    and a later seal redacts only its own segment -- it cannot see the half that is
    already gone -- so deferring would ship the completion untouched.

    The result is verified with the SAME predicate that fired, and that check is not
    ceremony: :func:`redact_for_display` scans a strictly SMALLER set of readings than
    :func:`severs_a_credential` -- it has no per-piece canonical reading -- so its
    rewrite can leave a match that only that reading sees, and a cut inside a link's
    target is exactly such a match. When the rewrite is not enough, the completion is
    dropped from the front of the pending side, stepping until the predicate is
    satisfied; the key's tail is what sits at that edge, so this removes the
