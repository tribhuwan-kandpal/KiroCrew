"""Where a redacted credential came from, recorded without keeping the credential.

The credential redactor replaces a secret with ``[REDACTED: credential]`` before
a message is saved. The reader then needs three facts the placeholder cannot
carry: that the value was removed before saving, where it still lives, and how
to see it there. This module produces the second and third.

The value itself is never retained. A tool result is fingerprinted as it is
redacted: every credential the redactor removes from it is reduced to a keyed
digest (the key is random per process and never leaves it) plus the ini-style
section it sat under. When an agent reply later carries a credential, its
digest is looked up among the turn's tool results. A hit names the tool call
that produced the value, which names its source: the file that was read, or
the command that was run. Only that description is stored in the message.

A command offered to the reader is either one that already ran or a fixed
template filled from non-secret parts (an AWS profile name). Never free text
the agent wrote: a command pre-filled into a terminal sits one keypress from
running, so a prompt-injected agent must not be able to choose it.
