    "+N more" only when there is a remainder to report).

    Three surfaces render this roster -- an unknown-agent refusal, the spawn
    tools' parameter descriptions, and ``spawn_list``'s output -- and all three
    come through the pipeline below rather than re-implementing it. Duplicated
    copies drift, so the SAFETY half lives here where a fourth surface cannot
    omit it:

    * **Grammar.** Every name must match ``_AGENT_NAME_RE`` before it is
      rendered. This is the load-bearing filter, not a tidiness check: an agent
      spec's ``name`` field is taken verbatim by
      ``agent_discovery._global_agent_info`` with no validation, so a spec can
      declare a name containing a newline plus instruction-shaped text -- which
      is pure ASCII, so an ``isascii`` check passes it -- and it would ride this
      string into a model's context. ``SPAWN_RUN_SCHEMA`` gates the ``agent``
      parameter on the same grammar, so a name that fails it could never have
      been dispatched anyway: offering it would advertise an unusable name.
    * **Redaction.** A grammar-valid name can still be credential-shaped (an
      AWS access key is pure alphanumerics), so each name goes through the
      canonical context-aware shim rather than being trusted.
    * **Bound.** Every rendered roster that reaches always-on context is capped,
      and the remainder is returned as a count instead of being silently lost.

    Order is the CALLER's: this returns names in the order it received them, so
    each surface keeps the presentation its own copy promises. *exclude* defaults
    to the reserved pair (reached by omitting ``agent``, never by naming one);
    ``spawn_list`` passes an empty set on purpose, because the two bounded
    rosters point at it as the surface that lists everything.

      a refusal is a decision, this is the absence of anyone who could decide.

    The message SHOULD name the surface that was missing ("no dashboard client is

    gate's own; that split is what keeps the gate's prose from going stale when

        is what lets the width be a single number.

        The width carries the uniqueness on its own, with nothing to remember and
        nothing to read. At 8 characters the id was 32 bits, so 2000 spawns on
        one host collided about once in 2,100 times, and the collision did not
        read as one: identity is assigned before registration, so the caller was
        handed the id and the accept then failed on the duplicate primary key,
        reaching the user as ``task store write failed`` -- naming a subsystem
        that was working correctly. 64 bits puts that at about 1 in 10**13.

        Drawn from ``os.urandom`` rather than a ``uuid4`` prefix. A v4 UUID spends
        its 13th hex character on the fixed version digit ``4``, so the first 16
        characters of one carry 60 random bits, not 64 -- a 16-fold worse bound
        than the width advertises, from a detail no reader of the slice can see.

        A checked narrow draw would need to know which ids are taken, and a
        durable task row outlives the process that wrote it, so it would have to
        ask the store -- which the spawn path cannot do, because taking a
        task-store connection on the event loop stalls every session's turn
        (:mod:`kiro_crew.on_loop_db` refuses it). Widening removes the question.
