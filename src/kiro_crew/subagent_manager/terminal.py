        Called from the exclusive one-shot terminal report, so a child cannot be
        closed twice however the race between the reaper and ``_run``'s ``finally``
        resolves.

        The closer is chosen from the runtime's own three-way ``outcome`` and never
        re-derived from error-nullability: ``completed`` closes as a completion, and
        ``stopped`` and ``failed`` both close through ``subagent/failed`` carrying
        which one it was. A stop is not a success and must not read as one, and it
        is not an error either.

        The parent session and the turn that asked are read back from the origin
        pinned at the dispatch, and released here -- the parent is very likely on a
        different turn by now, and asking which one would file this outcome under a
        turn that did not cause it. An unknown origin means the dispatch was never
        recorded (the flag was off then, or the parent could not be resolved), and
        the emitter's empty-session-id no-op drops the closer rather than inventing
        an opener for it.

        Every name is imported inside the body: this method does not end in
        ``_impl``, so it keeps this module's globals, where the facade's imports
        exist only under ``TYPE_CHECKING``.

        Returns True for exactly one caller. Both the reap path and ``_run``'s
        ``finally`` call this and report only if it returns True, so the parent
        is notified exactly once no matter which wins the race or whether the
        loser is cancelled part-way through its teardown. One exception: a run
        whose stream died under a reap's own reset (the reap-echo arm) does not
        claim at all -- the reap does, after its fallback kill has decided, so
        the report it publishes carries a kill that failed (see ``_run``).

        Contains no ``await``, so on a single-threaded event loop the
        check-and-set is atomic with respect to other tasks.

        Returns False while ``_recovering`` — a cancel-recovery respawn is
        pending and the agent must not be reported done yet — leaving the claim
        OPEN so the respawned run can take it later.

        ``supersede_recovery=True`` overrides that withholding and is used ONLY
        by definitively-terminal callers (`_force_reap`, which also serves user
        Stop). Without it a reap landing inside the recovery window stranded the
        outcome: the reap was refused the claim, performed teardown and set
        ``reaped``, reported nothing — and `_resume`'s ``reaped`` abort path
        bare-returns, so no path ever reported and the agent sat unfinished
        until the reaper's wall-clock deadline. Superseding also clears
        ``_recovering``, because a killed agent has nothing left to respawn.

        Scope note: this token governs REPORTING only, and it deliberately does
        NOT consult ``info.done``. Gating it on ``done`` is wrong:
        if ``_run_inner`` set ``done`` while the reap awaited its session reset,
        the reaper refused the claim, still marked ``reaped``, and ``_run``'s
        finally then skipped its own claim — nobody reported. The terminal RECORD
        (tombstone/stat) keeps its own ``not info.done`` guard and slot accounting
        has its own one-shot token (:meth:`_release_slot`); three concerns, three
        guards. Session teardown stays keyed on ``reaped``.

        This is the exact work the finalize claim guards: fire the
        ``subagent_done`` WS event, then inject the completion into the parent
        (``_on_done``) with its ``_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT`` cap, timeout handling, and
        (for the ``_run`` path) the result.txt TTL / workspace-cleanup
        bookkeeping.

        Why this is a separate coroutine run under ``asyncio.shield`` (see
        ``_run_terminal_report``): the claim makes reporting EXCLUSIVE but not
        ATOMIC. A claimer cancelled mid-report (``_force_reap`` /
        ``cancel_all()`` cancelling the task while it awaits ``_fire_event`` or
        ``_on_done``) would exit without delivering, and the other path — seeing
        the claim already taken — stays silent, so the completed outcome never
        reaches the parent. Running the report on a shielded, strongly-held task
        makes it complete independently of caller cancellation.

        The two call sites (reap vs. ``_run``'s ``finally``) differ only in the
        injection-timeout reason string, the log ``source`` prefix, and whether
        a successful delivery marks the result delivered — those are passed as
        arguments rather than unified away. The WS payload is identical (both
        set ``info.elapsed`` before calling), so it is built from ``info`` here.

        live under ``session_key`` is read and its handle RETAINED in

        """Best-effort SIGKILL when graceful reset hangs.

        Uses killpg to kill the entire process group, then sweeps
        escaped children in different PGIDs (MCP servers).

        ``handle`` is the process handle the caller took before the reset
        (:meth:`_retain_process_handle`), and it is the ONLY thing that names
        the process. The reset pops the session from the map before it can
        hang, and a session found under the key afterwards is a successor a
        cold start registered during the reset's awaits (a queued turn, a
        continuation) -- a different process, whose kill would leave the run's
        own alive while its record said reaped. So the map is never consulted
        here; ``session_key`` names the run in the log only. ``None`` means no
        session was live before the reset: nothing to kill.

        The root is validated twice against the handle -- it must exist
        (:func:`platform_compat.pid_exists`, the exit-code-confirmed probe on
        Windows) AND its start id must read back as the recorded one: before
        anything reads through the pid (a fresh child probe of a recycled pid
        would enlist another process's children) and again immediately
        before the signal, because the child walk awaits and the process can
        exit -- and the kernel hand its pid to another process -- while it
        does. The gap between that second read and the signal is the one a
        pid-based kill cannot close. The root is compared by start id and not
        through the child verifier, which denies a pid with no recorded
        basename -- and the root has none.

        Returns None once the run's process group has been signalled, and
        otherwise the failure, named as :func:`_teardown_failure` names one
        (``"ValueError: kill_process_tree: refusing …"``), for the caller's
        record: the broadcast guard's refusal of the pid, an error the kill
        raised with no pid-scoped fallback landing (on Windows, any error
        other than a gone tree: the fallback signals the root alone and
        nothing sweeps the descendants there), a live pid whose identity could
        not be confirmed as this run's (no start id recorded, or none readable
        now), or an error in the kill path ahead of the signal. This never
        raises -- the caller owns a teardown it must still finish -- but it
        never swallows either: a process left alive is the caller's to record,
        so its audit does not say the run was reaped.

        Nothing to kill is not a failure and also returns None: no pre-reset
        handle, no usable pid on it, a pid whose process has already exited or
        been recycled by the recorded start id -- at either read (the
        escaped-children sweep still runs) -- and a group AND pid that are
        both gone by the time the signal is sent.

        The escaped-children sweep is POSIX-only by nature: on Windows
        ``_direct_children`` returns ``[]`` and ``_kill_escaped_children`` is
        a no-op, because ``taskkill /T`` walks the tree itself when it can
        reach the root. So on Windows a root that is already gone leaves no
        descendant this code can enumerate, verify or signal -- a platform
        limitation of the child helpers, not a verdict this per-run record
        can make. What this method DOES report there is the case it has
        evidence for: a tree kill that raised while the root was alive, whose
        root-only fallback cannot stand in for the walk.

        Async so the Windows ``taskkill`` spawn offloads to
        :func:`kiro_crew.executors.subprocess_executor` via
        :func:`platform_compat.kill_process_tree_async` / ``kill_pid_async``
        instead of blocking the reaper loop's event loop for the duration of
        ``taskkill.exe``. The child-tree probe helpers also shell out to
        ``ps`` / ``pgrep`` on macOS, so they are offloaded to the same
        executor; the start-id read is in-process on every platform.
