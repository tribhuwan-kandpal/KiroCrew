"""Behavioural tests for the commit-author credit path in add-contributor.yml.

The workflow credits three sets of people, from TWO independent paginated
GraphQL sweeps: the author of each merged pull request and the reporters of the
issues those PRs closed (one sweep over merged PRs), and the linked authors and
co-authors of the commits that landed via a merged PR (a separate commit-history
sweep). The commit-author path is what closes the superseded-PR attribution gap
-- when a maintainer lands someone's work as a replacement PR (commits
cherry-picked or preserved via a ``Co-authored-by:`` trailer), the replacement
PR's own author is the maintainer, and only the commit-author path names the
original contributor.

Two design constraints are locked in here because both were blocking review
findings:

* the commit sweep must NOT be a connection nested inside the merged-PR query
  (GraphQL cost scales with the product of nested connections and would blow the
  API's cost budget on an all-merged-PR sweep); and
* it must be SCOPED to commits associated with a merged PR (a raw branch-history
  walk would credit internal authors who committed directly and never consented
  to public recognition, which the README promises against).

The logic lives in ``jq`` programs embedded in the collect ``run:`` block, which
no other test touches. These tests extract those programs from the workflow YAML
and run them for real against synthetic GraphQL node data, so the filters
(merged-PR scope, linked user only, bot exclusion, three-way union dedup) are
verified rather than assumed.

Skipped where the POSIX toolchain the scripts need (bash, jq) is unavailable,
which is the case on the Windows leg of the matrix.
