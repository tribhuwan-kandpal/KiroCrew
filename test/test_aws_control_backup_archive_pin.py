"""The backup archive's bytes are bound to ONE inode from build to upload.

``test_aws_control_backup.py`` covers the two push paths with ``put_file`` mocked
out, so nothing there sees which file the upload would actually have opened. That
is the question these tests ask. The archive is staged in a directory a same-UID
process can write, and a NAME resolved once per step -- the entry-set fingerprint,
the size, the AWS CLI ``--body``, the body fingerprint -- is a separate answer per
step. A process that replaces the file between two of them makes the upload carry
bytes nothing checked, and an uploaded object has no recall.

So the whole-run tests here go through the REAL ``storage.put_file`` and stub the
subprocess chokepoint, reading the body the way the CLI child would. A swap
performed in the window immediately before that child resolves the body is what
separates a name-based upload from a descriptor-bound one.
