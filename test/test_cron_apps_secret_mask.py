"""The apps tree is masked from every cron child that runs model-supplied code.

``<config_dir>/apps/<name>/.app_secret`` is a bearer credential, not a marker:
``dashboard.token_auth.validate_app_secret`` compares it and issues that app's scoped
token. Both cron exec paths run model-supplied code -- a script body under the
LLM-writeable ``crons/`` dir, and a ``command`` string the cron tool accepts verbatim --
so neither child may reach any app's secret.

What these tests pin is the WIRING, the mask target's existence, and the data window each
installed app keeps inside the mask. The two sandbox builders' own handling of a
caller-supplied ``extra_hidden_dirs`` tree and of a window inside it is pinned by
``test_sandbox_private_window_in_caller_mask.py``; asserting it again here would test
the builders twice and the call site not at all.

Every assertion is over the arguments the call site hands ``wrap_argv`` and over the
directory it leaves on disk. Nothing here spawns a child: the recording stub raises
after capturing, which the runners convert into a failed job.
