"""The run claim: one object per run, identity-compared, released whole.

``CronService`` keeps a run's per-run state -- trigger, start stamp, marker
token, generation, monotonic start, jitter, tracked task -- on one
:class:`_RunClaim` stored under the job id in ``_claims``. These tests pin the
object's contract rather than any one consumer of it: a claim is its identity
(two like-for-like claims are two runs), releasing it drops every field at
once (so a field added later inherits the fence), a claim that is not the
stored one never releases the run that is, and a claim ``cancel()`` or the
reaper has taken keeps the job occupied without being the run's to release --
and is its taker's alone to finish: a second cancel, a reap or a finished-task
discard that meets a taken claim leaves it to the teardown that took it. And a
kill follows the STORED claim, never a snapshot of it: the reaper sweep reaps
only the claim it measured, and only while the store still holds that object.
A taken claim is always finished, even when the teardown fails: a kill await
that raises still pops the claim and writes the run's terminal record.

    ``_reaper_loop`` iterates ``list(self._claims.items())`` and awaits inside
    ``_force_reap`` for each overdue job it meets (the session reset, the
    locked persist, the history append). While it awaits the first job's
    reap, a later job's run can end and a replacement claim the job. The
    snapshot's claim for that job then belongs to a run that is gone, and its
    stamps put the job far past its deadline -- so a sweep that measured the
    snapshot and took whatever claim the store held would force-kill a
    seconds-old run: session reset, task cancelled, ``last_status="error"``
    and a ``timeout`` row. The shape the claim replaced read the monotonic
    and jitter stamps live per iteration, so the replacement's fresh stamp
    made the sweep continue; the claim must give the same guarantee.
