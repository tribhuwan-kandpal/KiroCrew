"""The eleven authorable hook triggers, and the line the six new ones do not cross.

A Kiro Agent session has eleven hook triggers where the gateway has five, so the
gateway's own five were the only ones a user could author -- a hook for "the agent
just created a file" had nowhere to be written down. The six others are authorable
now, and these tests pin the three things that makes true and the two it must not
break.

What it makes true: each of the six survives create, save and a cold reload; the
form offers it; the create and update schemas accept it.

What it must not break: an event name outside the eleven is still refused at every
entry, and none of the six reaches a generated kiro-cli agent spec. kiro-cli's
``hooks`` map is a closed enum -- measured against kiro-cli 2.23.1, a spec carrying
one of these keys fails to load with "data did not match any variant of untagged
enum Repr", which would cost the user their whole default agent rather than one
hook.
