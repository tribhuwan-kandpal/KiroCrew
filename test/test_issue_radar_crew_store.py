"""Tests for the Issue Radar crew store: crew records, per-repo settings, and the
crew LEDGER -- work items, progress lines and the repository-shared skip index --
which is a fold of ``radar/recorded`` crew log entries rather than files of its own.

The coverage here is deliberately weighted toward the invariants whose failure is
SILENT, because those are the ones that corrupt the claim protocol rather than
raising:

  * **Name reuse.** A retired crew's name still appears in the check-in comments
    it left on the forge, so reusing it makes an old comment look like a live
    claim. Uniqueness is checked in the store because the name field is free text.
  * **``last_progress_at``.** The claim TTL is measured from this field, so a
    read-back or a no-op write must not renew a claim. If it did, a dead crew
    would hold an issue forever and nothing would report it.
  * **One editing item.** Two worktrees with uncommitted changes is how a fix for
    one issue gets committed onto another issue's branch. The store refuses the
    second one; a warning would not.
  * **Slot accounting.** Every unfinished item consumes a work slot, because a
    crew never holds an issue waiting for a human: one it cannot progress alone is
    recorded as a pass and its claim released.
  * **One entry per update.** The item's delta, the line that explains it and the
    skip row that indexes a pass ride on ONE appended entry, so no reader can see
    one without the others and a crash cannot separate them.
  * **The skip index is repo-wide and first-decision-wins.** It is a fold across
    every crew of the repository, and the EARLIEST recorded decision on a number
    stands whichever crew's log it sits in.

Every test runs against a ``tmp_path`` root -- the store threads ``root`` through
every crew-record function -- and against its own crew log data home, so nothing
here touches a real data home. A crew's ledger lives in the crew log of the
session its slot runs on, so a test that records creates that unit first
(:func:`_unit`) and passes its id as ``session_id``, exactly as the write route does.
