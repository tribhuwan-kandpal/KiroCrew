"""A lazily re-exported name has one storage location, in every package that has one.

Six packages re-export their public surface through a module-level
``__getattr__``. That hook runs only for a name the package does not already
hold, so any binding of the name in the package's own namespace wins every later
read and the owning submodule's value becomes unreachable through the package.
Two things create such a binding: a ``__getattr__`` that memoises the value it
resolved, and an ordinary ``setattr`` on the package.

Either one breaks restore-by-reassign, which is how ``monkeypatch`` puts a value
back: it reads the attribute to remember it, then assigns the remembered value
back. A harness that patches the owner first and the package second reads its
package baseline through the already patched owner, remembers the patched value,
and installs it in the package for the life of the process -- where the next test
in the same worker reads it as its own baseline.

These tests measure that, name by name, in both orderings: COLD, where the
harness's own read is the first read of the name, and WARM, where something has
read it already. A memoising ``__getattr__`` leaks only COLD, which is why the
orderings are separate cases rather than one.
