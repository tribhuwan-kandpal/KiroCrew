"""The macOS lane's placement, asserted from the workflow SOURCE.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The macOS pytest lane belongs in ``platform-tests.yml``,
which ``nightly.yml`` calls, and NOT on the pull_request path. The reason is the
runner queue, not the runtime. MEASURED on three green PR runs (34866269260,
34864945056, 34863753125) that carried the lane: the macOS jobs waited 176, 190 and
213 minutes for a ``macos-15`` runner and then ran for 26-33. Everything non-macOS
in ``ci.yml`` finishes at 78-98 minutes while those runs took 248-268, so about 64
percent of a pull request's CI wall clock was macOS queue time -- and because
``pr-readiness.yml`` (this repository's only required check) is triggered by
``workflow_run`` on ``ci.yml``'s completion, that queue sits directly on the merge
button. Across the same window the lane produced 0 failures and 129 cancellations,
usually still queued when a newer push superseded the run. At nightly hours the
same runners arrive in 0-33 minutes.

Three properties have to hold for that placement to be a move and not a deletion,
and each one is quiet when it breaks:

1. Nothing on the pull_request path may instantiate a macOS runner. A
   ``continue-on-error`` macOS job still holds ``ci.yml``'s completion, so it still
   holds readiness -- an "advisory" macOS job in that file is not advisory.
2. A red macOS suite must hold PUBLICATION and never a BUILD. The artifacts are the
   evidence a fixer works from; this is the same trade
   ``dependency-vulnerability-gate`` makes, and that test file pins the other half.
3. The opt-in on-demand lane must stay OUT of readiness' lane list, or the queue
   it was extracted to avoid comes back through a different door.
