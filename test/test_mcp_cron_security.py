"""Security regression tests for the cron command/script execution path.

Covers remediation of finding — a prompt-injected ``cron_add`` could
schedule a shell ``command`` (or register a ``script``) that read credential
files / secret env vars and exfiltrated them, because the command ran via
``sh -c`` under a weak sandbox outside the kiro-cli ACP permission/hook flow.

Fixes under test:
  1. storage-time deny-list on ``command``      (_vet_shell_command)
  2. exec-time sandbox raised to ``cc``         (run_command_sandboxed)
  3. cron_add absent from default allowedTools   (config/defaults.json)
  4. secret env vars scrubbed from cron env      (_clean_cron_env)
  5. storage-time scan of script contents        (_vet_script_file)
  6. validation regex documented as input-shape  (covered by 1+2)
