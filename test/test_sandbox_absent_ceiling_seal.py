"""An ABSENT crew-home ceiling is still sealed read-only by the Linux launcher.

``mount(2)`` cannot target a path that does not exist, so the ``READONLY_DIRS`` loop's
``if os.path.exists(target)`` guard silently skips a ceiling that has never been written
— and on a default install that is most of them, which left the data home writable at
exactly the names the seal exists to protect. ``_materialize_sealable_ceilings()`` closes
that by creating the absent ceiling first, but only for the leaves that clear both tests
the production comment states: an empty document must mean what an absent file means, and
a STALE read of it must fail toward refusal.

The load-bearing test here is
:meth:`TestSealAppliesToAPreviouslyAbsentCeiling.test_bind_and_remount_pair_is_emitted`:
it executes the launcher's own seal loop (extracted from the generated script, so the
production source is what runs) against a real filesystem, with ``_mount_or_die``
replaced by a recorder. Delete the materialiser and that loop records nothing, because
the guard falls through — which is the whole defect.

:class:`TestCeilingsThatMustNotBeMaterialized` is the fence in the opposite direction,
and it is the one to read before adding a leaf: three ceilings read a present-but-empty
file as something other than absent, and a fourth would be pinned stale in the dangerous
direction by the bind mount itself.

    The bound is the interesting half. The md-notebook sweep may take every ``*.tmp`` in
    its own directory because nothing else writes there; the data home root is shared, and
    ``atomic_write`` stages ``tmp<random>.tmp`` in it for unrelated stores. So the control
    test below -- an unrelated temp SURVIVES -- is what proves this sweep cannot unlink
    another component's in-flight write between its ``mkstemp`` and its rename.

    POSIX-only for a reason that is a property of the code under test, not of the test.
    The sweep lists and unlinks through a PINNED DIRECTORY DESCRIPTOR -- ``os.listdir(fd)``
    and ``os.unlink(..., dir_fd=fd)`` from :func:`_open_dir_anchored` -- which is how it
    refuses to delete through a component swapped under it. Windows offers none of that
    family, so the descriptor open fails, the sweep skips every root and removes nothing.
    That is correct rather than broken: its only callers are the Linux namespace launcher
    and the macOS Seatbelt builder, and Windows has no sandbox launcher to call it. Running
