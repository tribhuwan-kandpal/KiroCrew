"""An owner-DM channel session may act as a conductor; every other channel caller stays contained.

Three gates decide whether a caller's turns may reach another session or the work
ledger: the creator gate (``_refuse_ineligible_creator``), the target gate
(``authorize_target``'s caller half) and the ledger gate
(``handlers/work_ledger._caller_key``). Before this predicate existed they keyed
on three different facts — the live ``linked_session_key``, the key prefix, the
mirror store — and refused every channel-born session alike, which made a Discord
or Telegram DM whose only human is the configured owner unusable as a conductor.

The suite pins the one predicate all three now consult (``owner_dm_refusal``, the
clause walk that answers ``""`` for an admitted owner DM and otherwise names the
first fact that failed), its fail-closed edges, and that the gates cannot disagree
about a slot.
