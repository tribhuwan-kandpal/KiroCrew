"""Channel-side delivery of the spawn-approval prompt on Discord.

The host spawn gate's own surfaces are a Slack owner DM and the dashboard, so a
spawn parented on a Discord conversation reaches neither and is refused fast
(``no_approval_surface``) unless this channel offers the prompt itself. This
suite covers Discord's implementation of the channel-neutral delivery seam the
host gate consults FIRST, over the same Approve/Deny buttons and nonce guard the
main-agent tool ladder already uses here.

What is pinned:

* the SAFETY BOUNDARY — a channel with no registered hook still fails fast, and
  the host gate's behaviour there is byte-for-byte what it was without any of
  this: the seam answers ``None`` and ``SpawnApprovalUnreachable`` is raised;
* FALL THROUGH, NEVER DENY, whenever the prompt did not reach anyone: a send
  that raises, a send this client refuses by returning no message id, a
  destination whose authorization was withdrawn, and a channel the operator's
  channels ceiling denies all answer ``None`` (the gate can still offer the spawn
  on Slack/dashboard) rather than ``False`` (a decision nobody made). The armed
  nonce is retired in each case;
* ROUTING — a thread route prompts in the thread, a direct route opens the peer's
  DM channel, and a key this channel cannot address falls through;
* RESOLUTION — Approve resolves ``True`` and Deny ``False`` through the existing
  ``on_interaction`` ``a:`` path, under the key a press recomputes.

All Discord client I/O is faked; nothing touches the network.
