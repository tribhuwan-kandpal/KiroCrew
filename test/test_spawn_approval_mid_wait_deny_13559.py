"""A `channels` deny landing MID-WAIT falls through instead of voting for the operator.

The seam consults the operator's `channels` ceiling before a hook posts its
spawn-approval prompt, so a channel already denied is never prompted. That covers
only half the window: the host gate holds a spawn for as long as its approval
takes, so a deny can land while the prompt is still pending. From that moment the
channel's callback path drops the answering press -- every press except an explicit
reject -- so the prompt is unanswerable, the deny-by-default wait elapses, and a
bare ``False`` reaches the host gate, which returns it as the decision. The spawn
is refused on a prompt the operator has no way to answer, and is never re-offered
on the still-permitted Slack DM or dashboard surface.

Five cases are pinned, which together are the whole window:

* PRE-POST deny -- denied before the hook runs: no hook, no prompt, ``None``;
* MID-WAIT deny -- permitted at post, denied when the unpressed wait elapses:
  ``None`` (fall through), NOT ``False``;
* EXPLICIT REJECT -- a Deny press, which a denied channel's drop exempts, stays
  ``False`` even when the channel was denied while the prompt was pending;
* TIMEOUT STILL PERMITTED -- an unpressed wait on a channel the operator never
  denied is a real deny-by-default and keeps answering ``False``;
* FALLBACK -- a hook that cannot surface the prompt, or one that raises, still
  answers ``None``, so a delivery fault degrades to Slack/dashboard.

Answerability can also end by the conversation's OWN authorization rather than the
`channels` ceiling: `on_callback` checks `_authorized` for a DM and the shared
`forum_gate_outcome` for a Topic FIRST, for every press, with no reject exemption. A
peer dropped from the roster or a Topic dropped from the allow-list therefore
silences even a reject while the ceiling still permits, so that authority is re-read
when the wait elapses too.

All Telegram client I/O is faked; nothing touches the network, and the ceiling
predicate is substituted rather than driven through a real profile store.
