"""The standing auto-approve switch lives on an UNOPENABLE keystone, not in config.json.

A read-only seal on ``config.json`` closes a write to the sealed NAME. It cannot close
the inode behind that name: the crew data-home root is writable in every sandbox, the
agent runs as the operator's uid and so OWNS the document, ``link(2)`` needs no write
permission on the file it names a second time, and a bind mount seals a MOUNT rather
than an inode. ``sandbox`` states that fact itself where it refuses a governance
ceiling whose ``st_nlink`` is not 1.

The switch therefore lives on a leaf a sandboxed process cannot OPEN. Two properties
carry that, and each gets its own assertion below because either alone is
insufficient:

* masked rather than sealed read-only -- a sealed-but-readable leaf is still a
  ``link(2)`` source;
* a DIRECTORY rather than a file -- Linux refuses ``link(2)`` on a directory outright,
  so the alias shape has no source even in principle.

Every claim has a discriminating control beside it, so a vacuous or misspelled set
cannot make this file pass.

    is what refuses a gate spelled as ``cfg.agent.sandbox == "off"``: a governance floor
    raises a requested ``off`` to a confined tier, so that host IS masked and must keep
