 * The Crew Members page's React Query definitions (issue #9418).
 *
 * One module so the page, its tests and any future consumer (the sidebar's
 * Crew section, a command-palette provider) spell each key exactly once —
 * two inline spellings with different options would diverge silently.
 *
 * Roster freshness follows the dashboard's sanctioned pattern (see
 * queryClient.ts): pushed invalidation first, a finite staleTime as the floor.
 * The roster is a projection of the crew registry, so its key lives UNDER
 * `['kirocrew-agents']` — the prefix useWebSocket invalidates on every
 * `refresh` frame and the crew editor invalidates after a save — and a crew
 * created, renamed or starred anywhere reaches this cache without the page
 * knowing who wrote. The second segment keeps it a distinct entry: the
 * registry query returns `{ agents, default_agent }`, this one returns rows,
 * and sharing one key would let whichever mounted first decide the shape.

 * the page reads these entries through a `skipToken` query, which react-query
 * classifies as inactive (an observer with `enabled: false` does not make a
 * query active), so that filter would also clear the OPEN member's entry —
