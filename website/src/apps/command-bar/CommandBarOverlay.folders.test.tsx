/**
 * The Command Bar's FOLDERS VIEW.
 *
 * The bar is the default Cmd+K surface (`command-bar` ships `defaultEnabled: true`
 * and its manifest overlay claims the host's `quick-search` slot), so the palette's
 * Folders tab is unreachable for anyone who has not disabled the app. Folders are
 * reached here the way sessions are, and these tests pin that shape:
 *
 *  - the ROOT holds one row per corpus — `Search Folders` — and never the folder
 *    list itself, which is what keeps the first page from filling with the user's
 *    own filing before they have typed,
 *  - entering the view lands on the whole list, narrows as the user types, and
 *    reaches a child by an ancestor's name,
 *  - activating a row asks the sidebar to reveal that folder and lands on `/chat`,
 *  - the root issues NO request; entering the view is the activation event that may
 *    pay for one.
