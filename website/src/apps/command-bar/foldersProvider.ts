/**
 * Folders corpus for the Command Bar's **Search Folders** view.
 *
 * This lives in the app, not in the host's quick-search, and that placement is the
 * feature rather than a filing choice. Reaching a session folder by name is a
 * Command Bar capability: you enter one row and get a list that narrows, the same
 * shape session search and artifact search have here. The host palette
 * deliberately carries no Folders tab, so there is exactly one implementation of
 * "find a folder and land on it" and no second copy to drift from it.
 *
 * Type a folder's name and land ON that folder — the launcher closes, the chat
 * surface takes over, and the sidebar un-hides the folder, expands it and every
 * collapsed ancestor, scrolls it into view and flashes it. That reveal already
 * existed for SESSION rows (`requestSlotReveal`); this provider is what points it
 * at a folder.
 *
 * The corpus is the folder list the sidebar itself renders, read through the
 * SHARED `['chat-folders']` React-Query key, so a search is normally a cache hit
 * with no request at all. Matching is therefore entirely client-side (unlike
 * session search, whose backend does the ranking): {@link fuzzyMatch} supplies both
 * the score and the highlight indices, over two fields —
 *
 *  - the folder's own NAME, which is what the user typed at, and
 *  - its full ancestry PATH, so "kirocrew oss" finds `kirocrew › oss` and a name
 *    that only reads unambiguously in context is still reachable.
 *
 * A path match scores strictly below a name match ({@link PATH_MATCH_PENALTY}) so
 * the folder the user named outranks its own children.
 *
 * Ordering and the breadcrumb both come from `utils/folderTree`, the same module
 * the sidebar's folder pickers use, and the ordering takes the person's folder sort
 * mode (`dashboard.folder_sort`, injected as `mode`), so the view lists folders in
 * the order the sidebar draws them — Custom, Name or Date created — and spells a
 * path the way the server's `folder_breadcrumb` does. Re-deriving either here
 * would be a second answer to a settled question.
 *
 * `Result` / `ResourceProvider` still come from the host's palette types: that is
 * the row contract the launcher renders and the Enter matrix dispatches, shared by
 * every corpus view in this app. Copying the shape into the app would fork the
 * contract, which is the opposite of what moving this file was for.
