/**
 * The shared instant-tooltip spelling for the follow-up chips and ChatInput's
 * `ResizeBadge`. `PastePreviewTooltip` records why this repo shares tooltip
 * renderers ("so the two previews cannot drift"); this module is the same rule
 * applied to the hover bubble those two call sites need. The chrome, the
 * positioning and the show/hide gesture live here once; a call site owns only
 * its content and a width/wrap variant class. (`ContextBreakdownPanel` still
 * hand-rolls a sibling hover tip; migrating it is deferred, tracked on
 * PR #9552's review thread.)
 *
 * Semantics, chosen against the native `title` this replaces:
 * - Pointer shows after a short intent delay (`OPEN_DELAY_MS`, 100ms) — long
 *   enough that a pointer merely crossing the element on its way somewhere
 *   else paints nothing, short enough to still read as instant. The ~1s OS
 *   delay was the defect; zero was the flicker.
 * - Keyboard focus shows synchronously. A tab stop is deliberate in a way a
 *   pointer transit is not, and a keyboard user has no second cursor to wave.
 * - Escape hides while open, without requiring blur.
 * - A scroll that can move the anchor hides while open: the position is
 *   captured at show time, so after such a scroll the bubble would sit
 *   detached from its anchor. Capture phase, because the strips that scroll
 *   (`overflow-x-auto`) do not bubble their scroll events to window. A scroll
 *   anywhere else in the document leaves the anchor where it was, so the
 *   bubble stays (see `scrollMovesAnchor`).

 * stayed open -- a chip changing shape on a pick does that), or a target that
