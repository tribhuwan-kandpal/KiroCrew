 * (The Command Bar's Search Folders view reads the same entry through
 * {@link useFolderSortRead} without fetching, for the reason given there.)
 *
 * Read through the shared `['kirocrewConfig']` query rather than a dedicated
 * fetch: the sidebar already holds that query for its own settings, the sidebar
 * menu writes the mode through `api.patchConfig` and settles it back into the
 * same cache entry, so a picker opened right after a switch draws the new order
 * without a request of its own — and cannot lag behind the sidebar it sits next
 * to. The value is normalized by `readFolderSortMode`, so an older gateway
 * without the field, or a value this build does not know, reads as `custom`:
 * the stored order every earlier build drew.
 *
 * The read's failure travels with the mode (`error`) rather than being dropped
 * here, for the hosts that draw the tree on a screen with no sidebar to say it
 * (the job form on the Schedule page, the Command Bar): a picker silently drawn
 * in the stored order behind a mode the person did choose is a dead end. A host
 * that sits beside the sidebar's own banner leaves it unsaid -- one notice per
 * screen.
