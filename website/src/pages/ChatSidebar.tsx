 * incognito/temporary is a guard stated plainly, while dropping a session onto
 * its own pane is a harmless mis-aim answered with a recursive joke rather than a

   *   `filterTagIds`, so a reveal arriving while the tag vocabulary is still
   *   loading (when nothing is filtered yet) still clears the tag filter
   *   instead of leaving the row to be re-hidden mid-flight.
   *
   * Bundling every consumer's state into one memo couples them: a change to
   * reveal-only state (`filterTagIds`, `filterHiddenSubtree`, `folders`)
   * re-derives `filteredSlots` — one extra filter+sort with content-identical

   * ANYTHING on screen? Answered without rendering, because the render cannot
   * answer it: a nested block's `[]` is returned from inside the subfolder
   * wrapper's own render, which runs after `childNodes.push` has already committed
   * the wrapper — so `childNodes.length > 0` reads true for a subtree that draws
   * nothing, and both the drop gate and the header count believed it.
   *
   * That is not cosmetic. Searching "archive" kept `Sydney Property` on screen
   * wearing the count `1` — the `1` being a subfolder that did not render —
   * directly above the note saying no sessions matched. The row named nothing the
   * query asked for and the number contradicted the sentence beneath it.
   *
   * Each clause mirrors one thing `renderFolderBlock` actually draws, so the
   * predicate cannot drift from the render: own surviving sessions, the query
   * having named this folder (`folderNameMatchIds` already covers a matched
   * folder's whole subtree), the create-failure notice this folder owns, the
   * "N hidden folders" peek row filed in this container, and recursively any
   * child folder the tree is willing to draw. `visited` is the same cycle guard
   * `renderFolderBlock` carries, for the same reason: `parent_id` comes off disk.

                        The wording deliberately does NOT point at "the folders
                        above": the tree keeps a folder that merely holds a
                        subfolder, so a row that matched nothing can sit in that
                        list, and a sentence claiming it matched is the same
                        contradiction with the roles reversed. It claims only that

                              than the neutral chip styling every other meta chip uses:
                              this row's transcript lives on ANOTHER MACHINE, which is a
                              different claim from "has this tag" and the one the user
                              must not misread. The glyph is the non-colour half of the
                              cue, so the distinction survives a colour-vision
                              deficiency; it is aria-hidden because the crew name beside
                              it already names the target.

                              The tooltip names the OUTCOME, and it is the opposite of a
                              live peer row's. Activating this row calls
                              `selectInstance` — the pane switch IS its outcome — whereas
                              a live peer row opens the session HERE. The two carry the
                              same pill, so without this the identical marker would mean
                              two different clicks. */}
