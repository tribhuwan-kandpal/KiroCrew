/**
 * The one row the workspace tree puts under an expanded folder that has
 * nothing beneath it.
 *
 * The listing (`GET /api/project/tree`) arrives whole: there is no per-folder
 * request, so whether a folder has children is decided by the payload the
 * moment it lands, never by a fetch in flight. What the payload can leave
 * childless is a folder that is
 *
 *  - `empty`: listed as a directory with no file and no subfolder in it;
 *  - `hidden-only`: not empty on disk, but every entry in it is a folder the
 *    listing skips or hides (a dot-directory, a tooling cache, a symlink to a
 *    directory the walk does not follow) -- the server names these in
 *    `hiddenOnlyDirectories`, and without that signal `_bg/` holding only
 *    `.kiro/` would be called empty;
 *  - `unreadable`: the server could not read it at all (permission denied), so
 *    nothing beneath it is known -- named in `unreadableDirectories`; without
 *    that row the folder would vanish from the tree and its parent, holding
 *    nothing else, would be called empty;
 *  - `truncated`: it has files, but the workspace file cap left it none --
 *    the server names these in `truncatedDirectories`.
 *
 * `@pierre/trees` renders rows for paths and has no slot for a status line, so
 * each state row is fed to the model as ONE synthetic child path whose
 * basename is the label followed by `STATE_ROW_MARKER`. That buys the widget's
 * own indentation, virtualization and keyboard reachability for free; the
 * wrapper keeps the row inert (no open, no selection, no context menu) and
 * `PIERRE_TREE_STATE_ROW_CSS` styles it as a status line. Known cost, accepted:
 * the label is a real path to the library, so the tree's search matches it like
 * any other name.
