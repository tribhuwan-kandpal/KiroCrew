/**
 * The prerelease bug-report chip: the affordance that exists so a nightly or
 * insider user does not have to know that Settings › About has a Support card.
 *
 * The behaviours pinned here are the ones whose failure is SILENT — a chip that
 * quietly stops rendering on nightly, or one that starts rendering on stable,
 * both look fine in review and are only noticed when the bug reports stop
 * arriving (or when a stable user asks why the app expects to break).
