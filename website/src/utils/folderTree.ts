 * The one order siblings are drawn in: stored `order`, then name as a tie-break

 *
 * Both halves exist to agree with the Python reader, because `chat_folder_tree`
 * is what an agent picks a `before`/`after` anchor from and a sequence that
 * differs from the sidebar's makes the anchor wrong.
 *
 * `?? 0` is load-bearing, not defensive. A row written before the field existed
 * carries no `order`, and `GET /api/chat/folders` returns rows verbatim — so
 * `a.order - b.order` would be `NaN`, which is falsy, and the whole comparison
 * would silently fall through to a name-only order. 0 is what
 * `_chat_folder_order` coerces a missing key to.
 *
 * The name tie-break compares code units directly rather than calling
 * `localeCompare`. Two reasons, one per side: the host locale would order the
 * same two folders differently for two people (the i18n gate's rule), and ICU
 * collation would not match `_chat_folder_siblings`, which compares the raw
 * UTF-16 encoding.
 *
 * See `folderName` for why nothing is lowercased and `folderOrder` for which
 * `order` values are accepted; both mirror the Python reader exactly, and the
 * shared fixture `test/fixtures/chat_folder_sibling_order.json` is where that
 * agreement is checked rather than asserted.
 *
 * Exported because a folder's position is something an agent can set
 * (`chat_folder_move`'s `before`/`after`), so every surface that draws siblings
 * has to read it the same way — a render path that skips this comparator shows
 * a sequence the person never chose.
