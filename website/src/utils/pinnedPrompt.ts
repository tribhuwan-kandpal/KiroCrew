/**
 * Geometry + selection helpers for the pinned-prompt banner (the most recent
 * user prompt that has scrolled up to the chat fold, shown as a sticky band
 * under the session title).
 *
 * The hand-off is **top-edge driven**: a prompt scrolls with the transcript
 * until its bubble's TOP edge reaches the card's own resting top, and hands over
 * there. That line is where the card sits, so the bubble stops travelling at the
 * exact pixel the card occupies — which is the whole point. It is then pushed out
 * by the NEXT prompt as that prompt's top border meets it (`computePinPush`).
 *
 * Why the top edge and not the bottom (the rule this replaced): the bottom-edge
 * rule waited until the row was entirely behind the band, so any prompt TALLER
 * than the card kept scrolling after it had passed the card's position, went out
 * of sight behind the header, and the card then appeared back down at the fold —
 * content jumping down the screen after having scrolled past its own resting
 * place (measured at 78px for a four-line prompt against a one-line card). The
 * top edge cannot do that: `snapBackPx` is 0 by construction.
 *
 * The hand-off line therefore does NOT depend on the card's height, and must not:
 * the clamp (`PINNED_RESTING_LINES`) is a presentation choice that may change, and
 * a hand-off derived from it moves the swap point with it. A prompt no taller than
 * the clamp hands over with no size change at all; a taller one FOLDS in place at
 * the line, animated by the card's own height morph (see PinnedPrompt), instead of
 * being swapped after a journey. Both fall out of the same rule at any clamp value.
 *
 * The banner cannot be a real sticky element because the transcript is
 * virtualized — a row scrolled far above the window unmounts, so the sticky node
 * would vanish. Instead the banner is an overlay driven by the same math.

 * the FIRST prompt of that consecutive run — the walk finds the top of the
 * contextual block the target belongs to.
 *
 * Why not land on `target` directly: putting it at the jump chrome leaves the
 * prompt above it straddling the hand-off line — it cannot pin (its bottom is
 * still below the line) while its own top edge has already pushed the fallback
 * banner fully out — so the banner unmounts and the jump chain dies on a
 * landing the scan treats as a transient. Anchoring at the head of the run
 * puts a non-prompt row (or the top of the list) on the line instead, so the
 * previous turn's banner survives and the chain continues.
 *
 * The walk consumes only rows `isPrompt` admits — consecutive rows the USER
 * typed: a steer sent before the turn produced any output, a double-send, a
 * prompt typed while the previous one was still queued. Those are exactly the
 * rows that can pin and push, so they are the only ones that can straddle. A
 * steer sent before the turn produced any output lies directly on its opener, so
 * the walk anchors there and clicking that pinned steer scrolls to the prompt
 * that started the work; a steer that arrived after some output has a reply row
 * above it and is its own anchor. Machine openers (nudge and
 * subagent rows) are not prompts here, so a run of them above the target is an
 * ordinary non-prompt gap and the walk stops at the target: the previous user
 * prompt's banner then survives the landing exactly as it would over any other
 * reply row. A nudge is a one-line self-labelled system row and a subagent
 * completion a self-labelled headline card, so a landing beside either reads on
 * its own, with the banner above it naming the prompt the whole block answers.
 *
 * Walking up lengthens the jump. The virtualizer's near/far decision
 * (`mountIndex` in useVirtualChat) compares the anchor's jump window against
 * the COMMITTED window with `NEAR_JUMP_OVERSCAN_MULT` overscan windows of
 * slack (24 rows for the transcript, which passes `overscan: 6`) — a budget
 * shared with the distance the jump already covers, so the walk consumes
 * whatever slack a near jump has left over. In the common case (the pinned
 * prompt is the previous turn) that leaves the glide untouched; a jump
 * already sitting at the band's edge can be tipped onto the far path by the
 * walk, and that is the right outcome there — the gap is unmounted spacer,
 * and a glide across it would scrub blank.
