 *     (the #5672 class). When the final URL is unknown, `redirected` alone is no
 *     longer trusted — absence of the URL is not evidence of interception.
 *   - an HTML content type — the endpoint answers JSON on every path, refusals

 *    duplicate whose fate is not the row's: cancelling the queued message removes
 *    the card and leaves the bubble behind.
 *
 *  In both shapes "confirmed" would be a lie about a message that never ran, so
 *  a queued acceptance leaves the bubble pending and the 30s indicator keeps its
 *  say. This costs nothing in the ordinary case: a send made while the slot is
